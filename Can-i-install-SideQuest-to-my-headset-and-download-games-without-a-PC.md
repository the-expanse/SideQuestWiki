No and we will not be working on such a system due to various safety concerns as well as the possible Terms Of Service breaches such a system would break. The Oculus Quest requires an external device such as a PC to install applications and games with SideQuest as SideQuest is not installed onto the Quest device its self, You will always need a PC to install programs with SideQuest, Phones are supported but it is not recommended, and they only support normal APKs, be wary of viruses if attempting such.

##### We get countless requests to make an app store on the quest itself, but have not acted upon those requests. more info can be found in this [github issue](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/issues/409#issuecomment-592418360). But in short, it would not provide a nice user experience and the use of ADB protects our service since Oculus allows for ADB installed games or apps. These are the mayor reasons this has not been made into something that can be used.
