### Possible Issues With Ports

USB-3 is not truly supported and in many cases can cause connection issues, if the system is putting out an error when installing an application attempt use of a few different USB ports on your computer to be sure  that it isn't the USB port type causing the problem, if everything continues you can try a new cable in that should help, beyond that the connection issue Wiki at the top of this page should help.

## About The Queue System
Our Queue system is a how we are able to let users install many things at once without seeing a long loading screen and having your screen freeze up as an app or game installs making you unable to do anything else but stare at it and wait and sometimes it gives an error.

or the `Some tasks failed. See the tasks screen for more info` error,
you can access the Queue list from the top right of side quests dashboard, and attempt to retry your download with the retry failed button

##### For further errors with the `Some tasks failed. See the tasks screen for more info` error

Be sure to Check your Queue tab carefully to make sure it didn't just download an application twice in a row, as if a song, game or mod is already installed it may fail as it is already installed, otherwise check your Wi-Fi, your cord or another port on your PC.

Failing those steps try unplugging your Headset entirely and rebooting it, then restarting SideQuest, before you re-plug your headset in to attempting again

The system is able to as its name suggests, Queue installations and chain them so you can use SideQuest unimpeded and install Applications, Mods, Games and so on with much more ease, from now on after clicking `Install latest` you will see the green bar at the bottom appear and a number appear up top, this means your download has been added to the Queue and will be installed soon, the list will appear similarly to below.

You can access the Queue by clicking the number above, you will notice you can only see songs by Zip folder number, that is normal and unfortunately due to how the download system works can not be changed, you can usually see Game and Mod names at the tail end of the GitHub URL however such as The Expanse
