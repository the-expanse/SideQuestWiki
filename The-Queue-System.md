The Queue System is a way for you to install many things at once without seeing the old pesky giant circle loading screen as an app or song installs, you can access the Queue list from here.

The system is able to as its name suggests, Queue installations and chain them so you can use SideQuest unimpeded and install Applications, Mods, Games and so on with much more ease, from now on after clicking `Install latest` you will see the green bar at the bottom appear and a number appear up top, this means your download has been added to the Queue and will be installed soon, the list will appear similarly to below.

You can access the Queue by clicking the number above, you will notice you can only see songs by Zip folder number, that is normal and unfortunately due to how the download system works can not be changed, you can usually see Game and Mod names at the tail end of the GitHub URL however such as The Expanse
