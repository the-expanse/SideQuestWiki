The Queue System is a way for you to install many things at once without seeing a long loading screen as an app or song installs making you unable to do anything else but stare at it and wait,

If you get an error like below.

or the or the `Some tasks failed. See the tasks screen for more info` error, you can access the Queue list from here.
Check your Queue tab carefully to make sure it didn't just download an application twice in a row, as if a song game or mod is already installed it may fail because it is already there, otherwise check your Wi-Fi, your cord or another port on your PC, as well as unpluging your Headset entirely and rebooting it and restarting SideQuest, before you replug your headset and attempting again

The system is able to as its name suggests, Queue installations and chain them so you can use SideQuest unimpeded and install Applications, Mods, Games and so on with much more ease, from now on after clicking `Install latest` you will see the green bar at the bottom appear and a number appear up top, this means your download has been added to the Queue and will be installed soon, the list will appear similarly to below.

You can access the Queue by clicking the number above, you will notice you can only see songs by Zip folder number, that is normal and unfortunately due to how the download system works can not be changed, you can usually see Game and Mod names at the tail end of the GitHub URL however such as The Expanse
