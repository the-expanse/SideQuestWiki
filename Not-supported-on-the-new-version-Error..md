if your Beatsaber game says "not supported on the new version" or " Beatsaber Version Not Supported Yet #.#.#!!"to fix it all you need do is uninstall beatsaber from Sidequest in the APP's section in order to  reinstall it to your headset use Quickfix to return your songs, you should then be good to go, just open the game though beat on, if you still have trouble click "quick fix" in tools again, if there are still issues, reinstall beatsaber and try again
