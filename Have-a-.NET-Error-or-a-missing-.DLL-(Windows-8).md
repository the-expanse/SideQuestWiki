if you have a .NET error or a missing DLL when starting SideQuest and are on windows 8 or higher you can try installing the .NET core with this

[Microsoft .NET installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.2.4-windows-x64-installer)

if there are similar further issues you can always try downloading the base framework from

[.NET base installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55170)

Otherwise best to check Google or ask around in server to see if there is another issue not fixable via these installers.
