### Sometimes Quest updates some games will cause issues with games,
Thanks to changes in the headsets main systems messing with tracking, adding new code, removing old code and so on some Sideloaded games may start having issues such as having one hand in game, tracking not functioning, visual glitching, perma-loading or starting but just not loading properly,

Please bear with it during This and Future Quest updates as game Devs try to implement solutions as fast as they can
