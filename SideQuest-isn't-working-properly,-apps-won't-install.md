First thing to always check is your internet connection and a new cord, but the biggest offender people don't realize is VPN, if you have a VPN service provider disable it as SideQuest has to be on the same internet server as your headset so try Disabling it and you should be fine, otherwise head to the Discord and ask around again.

If you continue to have issue with only a few specific isolated Apps or Mods that fail to install properly after 2 or 3 tries please report them to [#issues-bug-reports](https://discord.gg/2bkwecn) in the Discord, just click on Share link in the Apps install page in SideQuest or copy the App/Mod URL and pasting it into discord channel stated above , We will then look into it soon as we can and either fix, or remove it.
