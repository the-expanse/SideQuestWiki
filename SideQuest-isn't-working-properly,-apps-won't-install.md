### First thing to always check is your internet connection and a new cord, but the biggest offender people don't realize is VPN, if you have a VPN service provider disable it as SideQuest has to be on the same internet server as your headset so try Disabling it and you should be fine, otherwise head to the Discord and ask around again.
