If transferring BeatSaber song folders from an old version, see [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Anything-else-users-should-know-about-installing-Beat-On-from-the-old-system)


If you played BeatSaber on the PC and have a bunch of songs downloaded already. and have just installed Beat On to my quest and would like to copy those songs over to your device Quest. locate the folder holding your songs in PC, make sure they are unzipped, then copy the content of your custom song folder to `My PC/Internal Storage/beatondata/customsongs` your quests internal storage should be under `My PC`

Alternatively you can zip the contents of each song folder separately and move those zips into the upload folder on Beat On Within SideQuest while connected
