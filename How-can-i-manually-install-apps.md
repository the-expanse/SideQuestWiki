Pirated full copies of official games upon the Quest store are not supported and will not function properly ever, they may also end up getting you banned with Oculus so be careful, also viruses are always a risk and SideQuest can not be held responsible for any game downloaded off any other website, knowing all of that and i you agree to these terms, that being SideQuest can not be held responsible for any exterior games or applications installed externally from other parties, continue on with the instructions below.


### Manual APK Installation Method
First make sure you have an APK and OOB to install as any other file types are not compatible with the system the Quest was built on. (it is essentially a overclocked glorified android phone so if your phone can't install it there is a 99% chance your Quest can't) if a bundled as an APK as long as the app is compatible and properly made it should work, next up open up SideQuest and make sure you are connected, if yet to install or it is not connected click [HERE]( https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/I-am-having-issues-Connecting-,-what-do-i-do%3F#resetting-your-connection-and-connecting-to-wifi), after that is done look up in SideQuest at the top right for a white icon with a down arrow in it, this is the APK installer so click the APK install button in SideQuest while connected be it over Wi-Fi or directly with a viable cable/cord as seen below

Then just locate the APK you desire (OOBs should be installed second and may not show as installing so just wait a minute and assume it did then restart your Quest) and in the popup tab and click Open

It should start installing right away and be able to be seen under the "My Tasks" tab as it installs and when it completes

If you can not locate your application in headset or within the MY APPS tab in SideQuest make sure SideQuest was open and connected and that the download succeeded in the MY TASKS section bottom left, be sure after manual installation to also restart your device before you check Unknown Sources, if you have yet to it is also suggested you install the [Quest App Launcher](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/199) for most games found outside of SideQuest or those that are self made, in it you can also play and launch 2D applications and games 

### SideQuest-less 100% Manual APK Installation Method Two (Windows)

First make sure SideQuest is open and connected to allow data transfer between your PC and Quest/Go, Then minimize it and head into your file browser to locate the Quest/Go, after locating it head into its internal storage to find the Android folder where all the other applications are stored and open DATA, located here.

Then make a new folder, name it com.``APPCREATORSNAME`.`YOURAPPNAMEHERE` Like below

And put the APK and/or OBB inside it, after doing so close your explorer and close SideQuest and reboot your headset before you look in unknown sources, the application should appear within it and be launch-able, if not open Quest App Launcher and check all the tabs within it.


### Manual Installation Method Three

If the above two fail completely, be aware you can also only install certain games APK and OBB files under the games tab,
Note this dose not always work and some games are incompatible with the system, But if they are compatible you can try and simply drag and drop them in to the top left corner of SideQuests GAMES tab, Always make sure you put in the APK first if there is an OBB present, making the order `.APK`, then `.OBB` (assuming both are present in the first place) Where to drop them is shown below.

If you have any other issues, attempt to check the name of the folder and try to match the format, that being `AAAAAA.BBBBBB.CCCCCC`
Once more, for phone and 2D applications or games that do not use the usual VR systems, hand controllers, Ext Ext) you will need the Quest launcher, or SideQuest 2D launcher from the applications tab in SideQuest, either can be used to let you find those types of games under unknown sources in your library.
