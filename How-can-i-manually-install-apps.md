It should start installing right away and be able to be seen under the "My Tasks" tab as it installs and when it completes

If you can not locate your application make sure SideQuest was open and connected and that the download succeeded, else restart your device and re check Unknown Sources, if you have yet to it is also suggested you install the [Quest App Launcher](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/199) for most games found outside of SideQuest or those that are self made, in it you can also play and launch 2D applications and games 

### Manual APK Installation Method Two (Windows)

First make sure SideQuest is open and connected to allow data transfer between your PC and Quest/Go, Then minimize it and head into your file browser to locate the Quest/Go, after locating it head into its internal storage to find the Android folder where all the other applications are stored and open DATA, located here.

And put the APK and/or OBB inside it, after doing so close your explorer and close SideQuest and reboot your headset before you look in unknown sources, the application should appear within it and be launch-able, if not open Quest App Launcher and check all the tabs within it.


### Manual Installation Method Three

If the above two fail completely, you can also install certain games APK and OBB files under the games tab,
Note this dose not always work and some games are incompatible with the system, But if they are compatible you can try and simply drag and drop them in to the top left corner of SideQuests GAMES tab, make sure you put in the APK first if there are other folders, making the order `.APK`, then `.OBB` assuming both are present, otherwise just DragDrop the APK file in, either way tany files are to be dropped into the location below.

If you have any other issues, attempt to check the name of the folder and try to match the format, that being `AAAAAA.BBBBBB.CCCCCC`
Once more, for phone and 2D applications or games that do not use the usual VR systems, hand controllers, Exc Exc) you will need the Quest launcher, or SideQuest 2D launcher from the applications tab in SideQuest, either can be used to let you find those types of games under unknown sources in your library.
