Apologies This generally only occurs with improper installation of Beat on after an update to Beatsaber, or because Beat On has yet to get updated to accommodate the new Beatsaber patch, it is suggested to wait for Beat On to be updated before installing any update to Beatsaber if you wish to continue playing and using your custom songs and mods at all as most times they will not function whatsoever directly after BeatSaber updates, the system may continue to ask you to update so just ignore it doing so until Beat On its self receives an update, of which you can find in SideQuests user DASHBOARD located below after creating an account and logging in

### Updating after Beat On get's an update, or getting properly installed 

Before updating make sure you back up your game as shown below only after dealing with your Mods,
If you have Mods Make sure you have disabled them, then sync that they are disabled to Beatsaber, and uninstalled all mods prior to any other steps to avoid confliction.

then for backing up you go to BeatSabers settings by clicking here

Then clicking the settings icon located here

and hit the `Save game data` button located here

This saves your Scores and other player data in case something goes awry as in some times there may be issues updating or bringing them up with the update and the scores may be found to be incompatible.


After backing up you then need to uninstall Beatsaber with the `Uninstall` button as seen below

After uninstalling Beatsaber Back out and uninstall Beat On as well from `My Apps` to make sure it is removed properly

Then you will require a proper clean install of your legally Purchased Beatsaber copy from the official Oculus store, next for updating/installing Beat On, to do so You just need to go to the Apps tab in SideQuest click here

or you may hit ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/608376262347587595/608391608572051457/Screenshot_1076.png) up top right of SideQuest while connected Via headset and enable it, then choose install, After that make sure you DO NOT patch from PC, run Beat On in headset, You can some times get it to work but the more assured way to patch with no issues is in headset by Launching Beat On under Oculus TV, then following the patch instructions and letting it patch your game from there, 

Your playlist and songs should ask to be restored automatically upon launch of Beat On, however 

#### Some users have some odd glitches when attempting to restore a backup data.

For odd cases like there there is a workaround,  where you can move the two backup files from the backup folder found in "my apps" under BeatSabers Gear setting icon after you back up below

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/615234075778875453/618711831552327680/backups.png)

you then can put the folders into the your headset manually. so Relocate both `PlayerData.dat`, as well as `Settings.cfg` to the following folder

Into your Headsets system by using either your native OS explorer or SideQuest file manager move them into
`/sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files` 


After that reinstall Beat on, for updating it is suggested to not agree to auto reloading songs and settings right away, try a test song and see if it works alone by installing it new from beastsaber and then syncing the song to your BeatSaber game, after that launch the game and test it, if it succeeds you can attempt to restore your songs utilizing the `Quckfix` function in Beat On's tools tab, `HOWEVER` this is ill suggested as it may cause issues and if it dose so you will have to delete Beat On data from your device before you start the process over from the start once more.

if you your test song worked and you did not manually implant your scores and settings already,
And if `Quick Fix` under Beat On's tools tab is not working properly, try reset assets and reload songs, your system should then retrieve your player data automatically, otherwise try to recover from the backup restore area below

If you have any issues reinstalling try a clean reset by deleting beaton data from your device, deleting beatsaber, deleting sidequest and reinstalling sidequest before following the steps above, ignoring any steps to do with backup restoring.
