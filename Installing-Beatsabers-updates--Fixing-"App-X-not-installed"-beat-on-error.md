Apologies This generally only occurs with improper installation of Beat on after an update to Beatsaber, or because Beat On has yet to get updated to accommodate the new Beatsaber patch, it is suggested to wait for Beat On to be updated before installing any update to Beatsaber if you wish to continue playing and using your custom songs and mods at all as most times they will not function whatsoever directly after BeatSaber updates, the system may continue to ask you to update so just ignore it doing so until Beat On its self receives an update, of which you can find in SideQuests user DASHBOARD located below after creating an account and logging in

### Updating after Beat On get's an update, or getting properly installed 

For doing either of these you require a proper clean install of your legally Purchased Beatsaber copy from the official Oculus store, next for updating/installing Beat On You just need to go to the Apps tab in SideQuest click here

This saves your scores and such, though some times there may be issues bringing them up with the update and the scores may be found to be incompatible so be warned.

After doing that, uninstall Beatsaber with the `Uninstall` button as seen below

After uninstalling Beatsaber Back out and uninstall Beat On as well from `My Apps` to make sure it is removed properly

Then proceed to reinstall Beatsaber from the Oculus 


### After reinstalling BeatSaber It's critical that when restoring data, you do it after installing BeatSaber, but prior you re installing Beat On.

Then you may reinstall Beat On from.

After that make sure you DO NOT patch from PC, you can some times get it to work but the more assured way to patch with no issues is in headset by just Launching Beat On under Oculus TV, scrolling down and Open Beat On then letting it patch your Beatsaber game from there, your playlist and songs will ask to be restored automatically upon launch of Beat On after reinstalling it and Beatsaber, for updating from beatsaber 0.2 it is suggested to not agree, try a test song and see if it works alone by installing it new and then syncing the song to your BeatSaber game, if it succeeds you can attempt to restore your songs utilizing the `Quckfix` function in Beat On's tools tab, `HOWEVER` this is ill suggested as it may cause issues and if it dose so you will have to delete Beat On data from your device before you start the process over from the start once more.

When Beat On is done patching Beatsaber you should then be able to retrieve your player data from here
