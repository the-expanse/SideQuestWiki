#### SideQuest is for PC only, not Mobile phones or Headsets

SideQuest is a side loading application and it requires an external device (A PC) in order to sideload from, so be aware installing SideQuest to your actual Quest device so you can download apps and games directly within headset and never touching a PC again is not possible, the SideQuest application within SideQuests own App Store is only a launcher for apps installed from SideQuest on your PC.

You'll be asked to accept the developer agreement, do so and then your set to move on.

Step 3: Install Drivers (Windows users Only)
====================================================

(Windows 7 users see [here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/I-Have-Windows-7,-can-i-use-SideQuest%3F)
