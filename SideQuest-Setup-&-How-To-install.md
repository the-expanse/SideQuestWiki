before installation make sure before anything to `use a phone USB cable that can transfer data` instead of the cable that comes with your Quest as the cable that comes with the device is not suited for data transfer.

Step 1: Install SideQuest
====================================================

Step 2: Create Organization
====================================================

To be able to sideload to the Headset at all you have to be a registered "developer" first, so just go to [Create new organization](https://dashboard.oculus.com/organizations/create/) on your PC and put in a dummy organization name. You'll be asked to accept the developer agreement, do so and then your set to move on.

Step 3: Install Drivers (Windows users Only)
====================================================
Make sure before anything further to use a proper cable, such as phone USB cable that can transfer data instead of the cable that comes with your Quest as the cable that comes with the device is not suited for data transfer.

To properly install the driver software for your device into windows. Go to this [Install drivers page](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-go-adb-drivers/) on your PC and download the drivers for your headset.
Though it may so it is for the GO The Oculus Go drivers work for the Quest as well.
To install the drivers extract the zip folder,

Make sure it asks if you want to "set unlock pattern" as that means it is off like it should be

Once you have enabled developer mode MAKE SURE TO REBOOT YOUR HEADSET to let your PC be able to see the device.

Step 5: Connect USB Cable and Allow USB Debugging

if it dose not appear and you are on windows, be sure to try the .EXE installer top instead of the ZIP folder, 

For Mac, use the Zip instead of the DMG else use the DMG instead of the ZIP depending on what you tried as your Mac may not have processed one of the two properly and may work better with the alternative, beyond that for connection issues, check [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/I-am-having-issues-Connecting-,-what-do-i-do%3F) after you are connected properly make sure to select 'Always allow from this computer' within your headset while still plugged in to your PC to prevent this message from coming up every time you connect and you should be ready to install Apps,Games and Mods.
