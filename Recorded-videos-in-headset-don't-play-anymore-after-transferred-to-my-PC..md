Having an issue with recorded files on quest not playing after you transfer them? You have to bring over more than one at a time and for some reason when transferring them, the cause is unknown but it seems to be Oculus's fault somewhere, for more information watch the video below.

Huge thanks to channel RaMarcus as always.
