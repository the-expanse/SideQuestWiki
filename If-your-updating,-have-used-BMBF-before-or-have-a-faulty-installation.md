#### Songs are safe even if the program is uninstalled but packs (how you organized them) are lost, after re-installation just open BMBF in headset, go to TOOLS and click it's `Reload song folder` button

Connect your headset to your PC and go to the `My Apps` manager tab locatable in the top right of SideQuests management bar, then locate BMBF and Beatsaber using the search function, click the gear to the right of both the applications and click uninstall on each of them, if you can not find BMBF search for the word `love` in the `My apps` tab (the Top right square of 9 squares icon) and it should pop up as `We Love Oculus` (or something similar), Make sure to uninstall them both then reboot your headset before you reinstall and then run beatsaber once, if you have the BMBF wrapper also uninstall that as it is no longer needed. After that just reinstall BMBF again as dictated in the steps [here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/BMBF/_edit#bmbf-installation-how-to)
