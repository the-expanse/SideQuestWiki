### Make sure you are on the most recent of both BMBF and Beastaber by following the below

# - (IMPORTANT)

Information you need to know for directly after you install BMBF
----
1. Be sure to restart your headset before you open BMBF in headset.
2. If BMBF upon running asks to uninstall Beatsaber click YES as this is normal.
3. Always run from OculusTV>Channels as it can crash and cause issues if launched from unknown sources directly
4. Make sure you click run Beatsaber via the top right blue button before installing or syncing any custom songs or mods to launch Beatsaber
5. DO NOT let the headset go into sleep mode during BMBF installation as it may halt the install process and cause issues resulting in a need to clean install both programs.



#### Songs are safe even if the program is uninstalled but how packs are organized are usually lost, after re-installation you can open BMBF in headset, go to TOOLS and click it's `Reload song folder` button to recover the songs themselves though

Step 1. Connect your headset to your PC and go to the ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/615234075778875453/695196680361869342/Screenshot_1464.png) manager tab located at the top right of SideQuest on the management bar.

Step 2. Locate BMBF and Beatsaber using the search function.

Step 3. Click the ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/615234075778875453/695197318315638894/Screenshot_1465.png) to the right of both the applications

Step 4. In both, click uninstall on each of them if you can not find BMBF search for the word `love` in the ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/615234075778875453/695196680361869342/Screenshot_1464.png) tab, it should pop up as `weloveoculus.apk` (or something similar,if you have the BMBF wrapper also uninstall that as it is no longer needed).

Step 5, After uninstallation turn your headset entirely off for at least 10 seconds then back on

Step 6. Reinstall Beatsaber from the Oculus store and then run beatsaber once to the menu. After that just follow the steps [here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/BMBF/_edit#bmbf-installation-how-to) to get installed once again
