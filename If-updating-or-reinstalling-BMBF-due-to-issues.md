Information you need to know for directly after you install BMBF
----
1. Be sure to restart your headset before you open BMBF in headset.
2. If BMBF upon running asks to uninstall Beatsaber click YES as this is normal.
3. Always run from OculusTV>Channels as it can crash and cause issues if launched from unknown sources
4. Make sure you click run Beatsaber via the top right blue button before installing or syncing any custom songs or mods to launch Beatsaber
5. DO NOT let the headset go into sleep mode during BMBF installation as it may halt the install process and cause issues resulting in a need to clean install both programs.
