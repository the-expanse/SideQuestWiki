Using Android phone or tablet to install APKs (such as BMBF) - Tutorial

# This is not meant for complete newbies!

WARRNING: ADB is a pretty powerful tool and installing the wrong apps, running the wrong commands or just fucking around randomly with it can permanently kill your Quest. I will take zero responsibility if anything goes wrong, this is entirely your own risk and decision. I tested this and it worked for me with my setup and LG G6, and it SHOULD work for any other Android phone or tablet, but is obviously untested.

It's also really difficult to fix any issues that may crop up using this method and it's software so if at all possible try your best to use a PC with use SideQuest to install.

### You'll need some basic understanding of Android devices and ADB.

You need an USB C-to-C OTG cable or an USB OTG adapter and an USB A-to-C cable.

Point it to the BMBF APKs you downloaded earlier. The order is not important.
