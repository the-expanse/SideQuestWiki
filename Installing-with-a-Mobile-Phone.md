Using Android phone or tablet to install APKs (such as BMBF) - Tutorial

# This is not meant for complete newbies!

### WARNING

ADB is a very powerful tool and installing the wrong apps, running the wrong commands or just messing around randomly with it can permanently damage your Quest, SideQuest will hold no responsibility if anything goes wrong proceeding means you willingly agree that this is done entirely of your own will and at your own risk.

Any Android phone or tablet theoretically should work with this method, however it is VERY difficult to fix any issues that may crop up using this method and its software so if at all possible try your best to use a PC with use SideQuest to install.

### You'll need some basic understanding of Android devices and ADB.

You need an USB C-to-C OTG cable or an USB OTG adapter and an USB A-to-C cable.
