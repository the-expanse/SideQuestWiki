Using Android phone or tablet to install APKs (such as BMBF) - Tutorial

# This is not meant for complete newbies!

### WARNING

You will need need some basic understanding of Android devices and ADB, So if you do not know your way around ADB and general coding commands or a lot can go wrong, loss of data, need for a factory reset and so on.

### If you have no idea what ADB even does or is DO NOT attempt this.

----

### This is NOT guaranteed to work

Note that this method is unreliable and even if it does work for you at first be aware that it is VERY difficult to fix any issues that may crop up due to using this method after installing or later down the line so if at all possible try your best to use a PC with use SideQuest to install.

### You could harm your Quest.

ADB is a very powerful tool and installing the wrong apps, running the wrong commands or just messing around randomly with it can permanently damage your Quest.

----

### We aren't responsible for any damages

SideQuest will hold no responsibility if anything goes wrong, Proceeding with the following means you willingly agree that this is done entirely of your own free will and at your own risk.

----

### On to business.

A last check, you could break your Quest entirely doing this so be warned.
Moving on, Pretty much any Android phone or tablet theoretically should work with this method but again it is not guaranteed, you will also need a few things to get started.


You will need an USB C-to-C OTG cable or an USB OTG adapter and an USB A-to-C cable.

4. Next connect your Quest to you Phone/Tablet with the OTG adapter.

5. After connected start the app you installed earlier on your chosen android device.

6. The Quest will ask if you want to accept connections from this Computer in headset, put the headset on and Select "Always" and "Allow" , if not appearing be sure to create a guardian boundary



You should now be connected, the device will show in the top area of the screen ("monterey" is the Quest). From here, select the package screen and to install a package:

Point it to the APK you want (BMBF if you downloaded it earlier) The order you install in is not important.

Once installed, you can start BMBF from OculusTVs Channel section and follow the usual steps.
