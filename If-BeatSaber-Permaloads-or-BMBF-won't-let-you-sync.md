##### `WARNING IF DELETING THE BMBF FOLDER`

###### `Deleting the BMBF folder will mean ALL CUSOM SONGS AND MODS are completely wiped and will note be recoverable with anything in the BMBFs TOOL tab. They will all have to be reinstalled once again from where you got them originally, though songs can be recovered faster if you utilize the Syncsaber bookmark system after making an account on Beastsaber.com 
with this method mods will always need to always be manually recovered when doing this.`
