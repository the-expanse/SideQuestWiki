If a mod was obtained from Beastsaber or some external website such as Beastsabers mods and are not sure if the mod was built for the Quest or from proper sources such as SideQuest its self or the [Redbrumbler Github](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/BMBFCustomSabers/tree/master/Sabers) know they more then likely are to be incompatible and PC only sabers so be sure you are installing a Quest compatible saber if having issues.
