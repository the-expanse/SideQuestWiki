This generally only occurs with improper installation of Beat on after an update to Beatsaber and will keep doing so until beat on it's self receives an update, after words make sure you uninstall both of them before anything, and make sure neither of them are on your device before reinstalling Beatsaber and Beat On, if you are having issues uninstalling just go [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/.My-apps-won't-uninstall-what's-wrong%3F)

The reason why is that after an update Beatsaber is now on a higher version number then the last saved APK in Beat On, so when it tries to sync your Songs/Mods back in to the freshly updated Beatsaber, it makes the version number no longer match as its APK has now been signed as the previous old version of the game, this causes Oculus system to think Beatsaber is the last version, thus "out of date" even though it is not, so clean installing both Beatsaber and Beat On at the same time though SideQuest solves the issue.
