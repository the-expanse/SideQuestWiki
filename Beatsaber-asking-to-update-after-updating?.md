Beat On when not reinstalled alongside beatsaber
(meaning you uninstall both of them first at the same time, neither being on your device)
causes this usually, When Beatsaber is on a higher version number then the last saved APK in Beat On, so after an update that version number is old and no longer matches causing Beat on to sign the Beatsaber APK as that previous version of the game when syncing songs or mods, this causes Oculus system to think Beatsaber is the last version, thus 
"out of date" even though it is not, just clean install both Beatsaber and Beat On at the same time though Sidequest and your issue should subside, if you are having issues uninstalling just go [Here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/.My-apps-won't-uninstall-what's-wrong%3F)
