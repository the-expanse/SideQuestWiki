# All about Un-installation of Applications or Games

## Uninstalling apps in headset not working is normal due to how the Sideloading process works



Modded or Sideloaded applications code get changed to such an extent that Oculus built in updater and Uninstaller will not be able to remove it anymore, such as BeatSaber after installing custom songs, so for Sideloaded or Apps or Apps modified with SideQuest such as Beatsaber with Beat on you must use SideQuest to delete them, either with the settings tab in "currently installed Apps" for official applications, such as BeatSaber.

For uninstalling modified apps like Beatsaber or Sideloaded Vitrtual Desktop you can uninstall them directly from here

if BeatSaber or any other application is not vanishing from your Quest Library tab like it should, try clicking it, if it asks to update do so and let it finish updating, then go about uninstalling and reinstalling one more time before proceeding, that will fix the issue

### An Alternative Way To Uninstall Most Apps if you have a SideQuest account and have set it up properly

You can find and uninstall most Sideloaded applications directly from the app page itself by going to Subscribed" located here

For applications installed through SideQuest make sure your headset is connected properly to SideQuest before using the Uninstall Unsubscribe button from your Dashboard if you wish to actually uninstall it, else it only removes the application from your Dashboard making it only visible Via the "My Apps" list, your Dashboard will also no longer tell you when updates are available for that app, 

## All updates for games or apps can be easily installed  with our "Update" system but some applications may need to be backed up then uninstalled first.
