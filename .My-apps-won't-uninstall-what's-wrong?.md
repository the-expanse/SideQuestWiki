## That is absolutely normal due to how sideloaded Apps work

### The applications code has been changed to such an extent that Oculus built in Uninstaller will not be able to remove it anymore, so for Sideloaded or Apps or Apps modified with SideQuest such as Beatsaber with Beat on you must use SideQuest to delete them, either with the settings tab in "currently installed Apps" for official applications Such as BeatSaber

### Also do make sure your headset is plugged in before using the Uninstall Unsubscribe button from your Dashboard if you wish to actually uninstall it, else it only removes the application from your Dashboard and stops telling you when updates are available for that app, all updates can be installed Via the Update button found here
