## That is normal due to how the Sideloaded process works

Modded or Sideloaded applications code get changed to such an extent that Oculus built in Uninstaller will not be able to remove it anymore, so for Sideloaded or Apps or Apps modified with SideQuest such as Beatsaber with Beat on you must use SideQuest to delete them, either with the settings tab in "currently installed Apps" for official applications Such as BeatSaber

if BeatSaber or any other application is not vanishing from your Quest Library tab like it should, try clicking it, if it asks to update do so and let it finish updating, then go about uninstalling and reinstalling one more time before proceeding, that will fix the issue

For applications installed through SideQuest make sure your headset is connected properly to SideQuest before using the Uninstall Unsubscribe button from your Dashboard if you wish to actually uninstall it, else it only removes the application from your Dashboard making it only visible Via the "My Apps" list, your Dashboard will also no longer tell you when updates are available for that app, 

### All updates can be installed Via the Update button found here
