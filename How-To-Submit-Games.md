Be sure to also try and add screenshots and a video to promote your work if you can, If only one screenshot is uploaded it will be used for the parallax banner at the top, but it will be hidden from average users looking at the page if there are no screenshots, otherwise the very last screenshot added will be used for your applications parallax banner.

## Add an APK File URL
You can then add your Applications Urls using Github Releases to add a download option for your app/game, You can see how to easily use GitHub Releases below.

The Github Release workflow supports auto-updates for apps on SideQuest - a one time setup allows you to deploy app updates to users automatically when you publish a new release to the GitHub.


## Warning
If you don't use GitHub Releases it is important to use a Direct Download URL, Meaning that your URL if copied and pasted into a browser should automatically download the APK, and do so without any kind of confirmation/download option needing to be clicked. an example would be that google drive would not work as you need to click a confirmation to install it, however you can use Dropbox if you change the file URL slightly as it makes it a direct download URL, for instance:

`https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsfgjg2g24gj42/MyCoolApp.apk`

requires to to accept, but if you add `?dl=1` to the end so the full URL is 

`https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsfgjg2g24gj42/MyCoolApp.apk?dl=1`

it becomes a direct download URL.

You can also use your own servers to host the app files or any facility that supports a direct download ( Glitch CDN, GitHub Repo Raw Link ). then just add the corrected direct install URL to the below

You can also add all sorts of social/donate/info links with the App URLs section from this page for things like app promotion.


## Promote your app even further with Events
You can create events with scheduled times that users can subscribe to in order to promote your app, this can easily be done in your user Dashboard as shown below.
