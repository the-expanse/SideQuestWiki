apologies This generally only occurs with improper installation of Beat on after an update to Beatsaber is installed it is suggested to wait for Beat On to be updated before installing any update to Beatsaber if you wish to continue playing and using your custom songs and mods at all as most times they will not function at all with most updates to Beatsaber, the system will continue to ask you to update annoyingly but just ignore it doing so until Beat On its self receives an update, of which you can find in SideQuests user DASHBOARD in the Web tab after logging in, after Beat On is updated to accommodate the new BeatSaber update make sure you uninstall both of them before anything, and make sure neither of them are on your device before reinstalling Beatsaber and Beat On, if you are having issues uninstalling just go [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/.My-apps-won't-uninstall-what's-wrong%3F)

The reason why is that after an update Beatsaber is now on a higher version number then the last saved APK in Beat On, so when it tries to sync your Songs/Mods back in to the freshly updated Beatsaber, it makes the version number no longer match as its APK has now been signed as the previous old version of the game, this causes Oculus system to think Beatsaber is the last version, thus "out of date" even though it is not, so clean installing both Beatsaber and Beat On at the same time though SideQuest solves the issue.
