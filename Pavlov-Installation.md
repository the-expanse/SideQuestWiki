### Pavlov is not currently supported by SideQuest and will be officially purchasable Via the Oculus app store in the future.

#### Pavlov Discord link
For any issues or help installing Pavlov see the links at the top of this page otherwise head to the  [OFFICIAL PAVLOV DISCORD SERVER](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB) for direct instructions as SideQuest can not assist you past this page. 

##Here is a Windows only guide (This is the most support we can provide in the matter)


Also do make sure you have the most recent Folder for PavLov from [LATEST PAVLOV BUILDS](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB)
that is usually an issue people overlook as they install an old version or incorrect file/folder.

### NOTE the file name may not be the same anymore but the process of right clicking and extraction of the folder will be.

Also note that the "Go driver" folders shown in the pictures below are Example folders, you do these steps to extract files with your installed zipped (un-extracted) Pavlov folder, You can tell if it is not extracted by if the folder icon has a zipper on it.

Then delete the Zip folder you extracted from to make the new folder, before you open the new unzipped folder

Then just use the built in installer for the Pavlov from the new Extracted folder, not the original zipped folder.                                              

### DO NOT drag and drop the files into SideQuest, Use the "Install.bat" located below

It may or may not have (.bat) at the end but it is the same, just run that while SideQuest  is running and connected to your headset, a window will then pop up and run some installation code, let that run and when finished click enter, also again make sure you are using the newest version of the Pavlov installer, else some errors may occur, such as only one hand working at a time and visual glitching, after using the Install.Bat file, after it finishes close SideQuest and reboot your headset, then open the game in Headset under Unknown Sources or Oculus TV if it appears, it will take some time to load for it's initialization boot so wait 5 or so minutes.


### If you have issues beyond that

You can go to the [PAVLOV DISCORD](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB), that will take you to their official Discord where you can ask for further and more in depth assistance, they have a wonderful server that we are sure would be delighted to help with any issues you may be experiencing, feel free to head there and ask for help from the pros of Pavlov and voice any concerns to them.

'Note' that The Expense, SideQuest and it's affiliates can not be held responsible for, or maintain troubleshooting support with Pavlov as it will soon be on the official Oculus Store, Anything beyond the below is out of our hands and updates to this how to will be few to non existent if they become outdated.
