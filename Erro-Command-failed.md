This could be a few things, the first and easiest thing to attempt is to try a new cable or to enable wireless mode for SideQuest and ulug to install over your router, Failing that if using Windows you can try launching SideQuest opening and checking your Windows task manager for `ADB.exe` and right clicking it, then selecting `open folder location` and closing SideQuest, then in the task manager ending the `ADB.exe` process and finally in the folder it is in deleting it, after that restart SideQuest and see if your issue is resolved, if not repeat it once more and see if `ADB.exe` is in a new folder and delete it. If that does not solve your issue you can try closing SideQuest and disable then re enabling developer mode in your phones Oculus mobile application on a cellphone or tablet, if after replugging the headset you still have the issue check our connections issue page located
