After installing the Sidequest DMG from https://sidequestvr.com/#/download , If you get an error about Apple not being able to check for malicious software the first time you launch SideQuest just right-click on the application, select open from the pop-up menu, the same window will show, so now just click "Open"  and SideQuest will now run successfully. You only need to do this once on the first run. 
The devs know about this and it will be fixed soon.
