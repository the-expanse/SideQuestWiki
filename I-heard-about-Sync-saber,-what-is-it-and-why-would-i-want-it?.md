sync saber is an amazing new feature of Beat On that allows you to opt into "packs" and sync many songs at once from the current list, for example if you wanted the top 50 most popular songs but did not want to install by hand each one 1 at a time you would click HOT SONGS  on, set the desired number to the right of it to 50 and click the secondary sync button, a pack called HOT then would appear in your playlist with 50 popular songs which you could then sync into your game ,
