If you are having trouble connecting and obtain the ECONNRESET error try another USB port and cable, If the error persists try checking the Tasks section within SideQuest at its upper right (3 bars and a check mark, it may have a number on it) for more details about what app or game may have failed, lastly you can see if disconnecting your headset before restarting SideQuest to try again helps.
