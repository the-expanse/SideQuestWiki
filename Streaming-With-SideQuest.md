## You Can Stream Wireless

You can do this by enabling Wi-Fi mode in the top right with the wireless button, make sure to be connected by cable when enabling this feature and wait until the connection dot is purple before unplugging then launch the streamer and you should see it pop up with your screen live, you can also install apps and manage in headset recorded material this way.

### There is no audio

There will be no game sound streaming and this feature is highly unlikely at all let alone any time soon so you will need an alternative solution.

### Alternative Audio Solutions

You can use a Bluetooth transmitter hooked to your headset and a Bluetooth receiver hooked to your PC which shouldn't have to bad of lag with good quality one (Always check the reviews if looking for good ones), Else you can use a proper physical AUX audio cable from your headsets headphone jack to your PC to allow transmission of in game sounds along side the Video.


### Cropping
The SideQuest streamer has it set to auto crop the original video usually sent to SCRCPY due to it being unsuitable for streaming to begin with, but you can change the crop to your liking in the settings and mess about with it.
