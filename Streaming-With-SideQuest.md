## You Can Stream Wireless

You can do this by enabling Wi-Fi mode in the top right with the wireless button, make sure to be conencted by cable when enabling this feature and wait until the connection dot is purple before unplugging then launch the streamer and you should see it pop up with your screen live, you can also install apps and manage in headset recorded material this way.

### There is no audio

There will be no game sound streaming and this feature is highly unlikely at all let alone any time soon so you will need an alternative solution such as a Bluetooth transmitter hooked to your headset and a Bluetooth receiver hooked to your PC, or a proper AUX cable from your headset jack to your PC if you wish to have in game sound.
