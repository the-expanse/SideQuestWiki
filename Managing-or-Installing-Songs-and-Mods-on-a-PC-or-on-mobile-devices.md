You can get a song zip from `Beastsaber.com` or `beatsaver.com` (Not Mods as they are PC only), in your PC browser as long as you are on the same Wi-Fi connection type your Quests IP (Found top left of SideQuest when connected" followed by `:50000`, Be sure to type the IP properly in your browser on whatever device you are attempting to use then type `:50000` fully, it should open a page for BMBF management then, after that if on PC you can to the upload tab and install it there, make sure to always have BMBF open and running in headset when managing on other devices.
You can also use this method to install mod zip folders but that is ill advised as most are PC only and not compatible with the Quest so if not obtained Via SideQuests own list be wary
You can manage your playlists and even install songs from a phone or tablet  using the same IP from their browser  so long as the device and your Quest are on the same Wi-Fi network.
