When using SideQuest and installing Patches or Mods to game officially purchased from the App store in your headset, SideQuest installs the Patch over the normal code, making the code unreadable to the Official store, so your Quest can no longer Uninstall the App normally, you need to go into SideQuest's Apps tab and find the application, then click the Gear icon to the right of it and click `Uninstall`, the application will then properly be removed and you can reinstall at will later on as you desire.
