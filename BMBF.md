## -What happens to your old Purchased, Custom songs and mods if you are updating to BMBF from a previous version or from Beat On
----

The system should automatically transfer songs and Mods up despite the program being uninstalled as songs and mods are archived in a special folder so they will not be deleted without manual removed of it's folder by the user.For purchased packs make sure however you install them to your base game prior to modding it with BMBF.

If they are not present try and go to the Tools tab in BMBF in PC or Headset and click Reload Song Folder, Then sync and launch the game and they should appear then.If purchased packs still do not appear try to re install from scratch completely by 
 deleting the BMBF folder from your headset in the SideQuest explorer.

## - If BeatSaber Permaloads or BMBF won't let you sync
----

If this occurs be sure to check in your main library click the 3 dot button on Beatsabers game icon, then go to Permissions and turn allow Storage permissions for the game, if the issue persists then restart your device and it should subside, 
If it continues try dis and re enabling the storage permissions and hard restart your headset by holding the power button for 15 seconds, if it still persists it would be best to clean install following the directions below from scratch, make sure to remove all related programs (Beatsaber, BMBF, BeatOn) before installing Beatsaber again and starting the process.


##### `WARNING IF DELETING THE BMBF FOLDER`

###### `Deleting the BMBF folder will mean ALL CUSOM SONGS AND MODS are completly wiped and will note be recoverable with anything in the BMBFs TOOL tab. They will all have to be reinstalled once again from where you got them originally, though songs can be recovered faster if you utilize the Syncsaber bookmark system after making an account on Beastsaber.com 
with this method mods will always need to always be manually recovered when doing this.`

## For Transferring up Purchased Packs and Save Data
----

Make sure to run SideQuest and back up your player data from Beatsabers Gear icon, then you can reload your save data from the My Apps tab and that the scores can be seen in the base game Prior to installing BMBF, For Purchased Packs make sure restart the headset entirely by powering it off for at least 5 seconds then back on, then you can install them to your base game BEFORE modding it with BMBF so be sure after re-installation of a clean Beatsaber to buy/re download any packs you have or want in game prior to doing anything with BMBF, Then you can install and run the BMBF installer from PC while connected as normal


# - (IMPORTANT) Directly after you install BMBF
----
Make sure to properly restart your headset after you install BMBF and to after doing so open BMBF from the Quests `Oculus TV` tab run Beatsaber via the top right blue or red glowing button from BMBF before syncing any of your own other custom songs or mods, it will also upon running ask to uninstall Beatsaber, click YES as it does this in order to copy the beatsaber apk and inject the modded code into it so it reinstall right away, DO NOT let the headset go into sleep mode during BMBF installation as it may halt the install process and cause issues resulting in a need to clean install both programs.

## Make sure you have properly uninstalled any non functioning or old BeatSaber and BMBF using SideQuests "My Apps" tab before proceeding if updating to a new version or previously installed and faulty.

## - Alternative ways to install Mods or Songs

So long as BMBF is properly installed SideQuest may be used to install mods from it's BMBF mod tab or also you can directly add unzipped songs into the BMBF custom song folder via dragdrop files into your file explorer, the file path should be Quest>InternalStorage>BMBFdata>customsongs , you can do this either with either a Cable or using SideQuests Wireless mode, so long as it states it is connected they will install, you can also for mods just locate a mod you desire and install it by clicking Install latest like any game, though some may be out dated or non functioning so be aware of the convenient `Reset assets` button within BMBFs tools tab, Be aware any mods obtained externally from SideQuest more then likely are PC only such as those from BeastSaber.com
When ever manually adding mods or songs be sure to click "reload song folder" in BMBFs tools tab then you should see them appear.

# - Updating Beatsaber before BMBF get's an update to match.

Something to be aware of is that when ever Beatsaber gets updates it usually (at least for a while) makes BMBF non functional for the updated version, so do not update right away if you care for your custom songs for importing custom songs and 
mods, Apologies but if you have updated and BMBF has stopped functioning there is little to be done, You can see if there is a backed up APK in the BMBF data backup folder in your device to recover to, if so be sure to uninstall Beatsaber first 
before using the backup, (usually called "donotuse" as an anti tamper measure) with the install APK button top right of SideQuest, Otherwise if you are new to BMBF and/or have no backup you will have to wait until the creators of BMBF are able to do some work to update BMBF and decided their work is ready to be released, until then the only thing to do is wait till they put out a new installer that is compatible with Beatsabers updated version to be able to be used and let you install custom songs once more,The time frame of which no one knows as each update is different.
