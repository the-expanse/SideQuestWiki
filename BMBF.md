###### SideQuest is NOT responsible for BMBF, how it modifies BeatSaber or what it does and can not be held responsible for any issues that occur upon install be they from user error or from the program side.

## Beat On has long since been Discontinued, BMBF is what has replaced it.

`Note that BMBF is a standalone replacement for Beat On of which SideQuest no longer supports. to install it follow the steps below. BMBF tries to recover songs, save data and such all automatically if you are transferring from Beat On.`

### - MAKE SURE TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL PAID FOR VERSION OF BEATSABER FROM THE OFFICIAL OCULUS QUEST STORE

Like Beat On before it BMBF will NOT work without an official validation from your system so you will need to have bought the game and installed it before hand.

# - If your game perma loads with 3 dots
If this occurs be sure to in your main library click the 3 dot button on Beatsabers game icon, then go to Permissions and turn allow Storage permissions for the game, if the issue persists then restart your device and it should subside, If it continues try dis and re enabling the storage permissions and hard restart your headset by holding the power button for 15 seconds, if it still persists it would be best to clean install following the directions below from scratch, make sure to remove all related programs (Beatsaber, BMBF, BeatOn) before installing Beatsaber again and starting the process.

# - To Install OR update BMBF 


### - If you have modded before or your current BMBF is Non-functioning

First you need to get a clean unmodded Beatsaber version installed and run it to Solo mode (open the game and enter solo mode) before closing it for the newest BMBF to be able to patch properly. Also if you care for your scores be sure to back them up in the SideQuests my tasks area before uninstalling Beatsaber

###- To uninstall Properly

o to the my task tab in sidequest and click the gear to the right of the application and click uninstall, you can do the same for BMBF's old version using SideQuests my apps tab by searching the word `love` in the My apps tab and it should pop up as `We Love Oculus`and uninstall it by clicking the gear icon to the right and clicking uninstall, Then find and remove the BMBF related `Wrapper` 
(Uninstall Beat On if you have that still)


`Note any modifications to official games make them unable to update or uninstall naturally in headset, You can uninstall them in SideQuest's  my apps tab under the app settings icon (a Gear icon) to its right. Then just reinstall your game from the official Oculus store.`

### For save data
Make sure to run SideQuest and reload your save data from the My Tasks tab and that the scores can be seen in the base game Prior to installing BMBF.


### For purchased packs
`Be sure after re-installation to buy/re download any packs you have or want in game BEFORE patching with BMBF,
Then install and run the BMBF installer from PC while connected, which can be downloaded from the below link and run it in headset from the Oculus TV  Channels subsection after it is done`

# Make sure to read ALL the information above before proceeding with BMBFs installation

#### BMBF Auto installer 
https://github.com/kihecido/BMBF/releases
(Find the highest version number as that will the the most recent and latest one)


#### BMBF OS GUIDE

Make sure you get the proper one suited to your OS by
Following the guide below

##### Windows
`BMBFInstaller.Setup.X.X.X-x64-win.exe`

##### MAC
`BMBFInstaller-X.X.X.dmg`

##### Linux
`BMBFInstaller-X.X.X.tar.xz`


##### Manual installation

(DO NOT MANUALLY INSTALL THESE APKS IF YOU USE THE AUTO INSTALLER EXE/DMG/TAR.XZ, Using both can cause various issues)

Both `BMBF_TVWrapper.apk` And `com.weloveoculus.BMBF.apk` are for manual installation only so unless you have issues with the auto installer they are un-needed and should not be installed.

If manually installing due to issues download both the APKs mentioned above, then launch SideQuest and click the button top right that when hovered over says `Install APK file from folder`, then you can locate and install both of the APKs in the popup window before restarting your headset, BMBF should then be located in headset under OculusTV under `Channels`.

### - After running the BMBF installer

Make sure to restart your headset, and that you connect your headset to your PC and run the BMBF installer on it and flip it to the on position, Then put your headset on and inside the headset (If not already opened and running) launch it from the main menu found in `OculusTV>Channels>BMBF` to let it patch, uninstall beatsaber and install the modded BMBFbeatsaber copy to your headset.

After installing BMBF you should make sure to run the game from BMBFs launch button top right of the app without syncing any other custom songs yet, to do so just head in in headset and run Beatsaber from Oculus TVs Channels Sub section, to make sure beatsaber is properly working and connected, 
Restarting your Quest device also helps so make sure to try that as well if having issues.

### - If you had purchased DLC, mods or custom songs installed before hand

The system will automatically transfer them to its self, for bought packs make sure however you install them to your base game prior to modding it with BMBF.
If they are not present go to the Tools tab in BMBF in PC or Headset and click Reload Song Folder, Then sync and launch the game and they should appear then.

### - PC song and mod management

You can manage BMBF on PC connecting your headset to your PC and RE:running the installer, clicking the switch that appears to the "on" position in the switch and  clicking 
"Open BMBF" it will open a page for it,

### - If BMBF acts like Beatsaber isn't installed

Close the PC Installer/Launcher then in headset open BMBF in Oculus TVs Channels subsection and run the Beatsaber from it to solo mode before closing it, Dis and reconnecting your headset from your PC and Re:running the installer, Make sure to wait for it to say connected in the bottom left before flipping it on and clicking "open BMBF" , Other things to try include Restarting your Computer, Trying a new Cable, Trying a new Port on your computer, uninstalling the BMBF installer and reinstalling it and Clicking `Reset ADB` in the ADB connection management area of SideQuest under the `Run ADB Commands" button top right of SideQuest.
 

## The BMBF installer is also a launcher so if you launch the BMBF installer when connected to your headset a second time it will allow you to click "Open BMBF" and it will launch a web page allowing management of BMBF and your songs and mods from PC, letting users install zips manually of songs and mods from it's UPLOAD tab

#### Getting Songs with your PC
You can get a zip from `Beastsaber.com` or `beatsaver.com` and click open BMBF on your PCs BMBF Installer/Launcher
then go to the upload tab and install it there.

Alternatively you can use the built in bookmark system which is a bit easier, just log into a beastsaber account on your PC or phone in a web browser, find a song you like, click the bookmark icon on songs you want, and then in headset in the BMBF applications syncsaber tab put your user name/bookmark list name and enable bookmarks to infinite mode (set it to below zero) then you just click the sync button on the page and let them install, then your done.

#### - Alternative ways to install Mods

So long as BMBF is properly installed SideQuest may be used to install mods from it's BMBF mod tab through a Cable of from Wireless mode if connected that way.

You can also install mods by running the BMBF insteller.exe again and clicking open BMBF, then going to the upload tab in the browser page that opens and installing a ZIP file for a mod you have by dragdropping the zip folder over the large upload button. 






##### Note that Beat On is no longer supported or updated, and won't be anywhere ever again, and that BMBF is it's replacement, and has it's own installer that you can use to download it right into your headset, also to be aware of is that when ever Beatsaber gets updates it usually (at least for a while) make BMBF non functional for importing custom songs and mods, Apologies but if you have updated and BMBF has stopped functioning there is little to be done, You can see if there is a backed up APK in the BMBF data backup folder in your device to recover to, if so be sure to uninstall Beatsaber first before using the backup, (usually called "donotuse" as an anti tamper measure) with the install APK button top right of SideQuest, Otherwise if you are new to BMBF and/or have no backup you will have to wait until the creators of BMBF are able to do some work to update BMBF and decided their work is ready to be released, until then the only thing to do is wait till they put out a new installer that is compatible with Beatsabers updated version to be able to be used and let you install custom songs once more,The time frame of which no one knows as each update is different.
