### To get or update BMBF

Beat On has long since been Discontinued, BMBF is what has replaced it.

Note that BMBF is a standalone replacement for Beat On of which SideQuest no longer supports. to install it follow the steps below. BMBF tries to recover songs, save data and such all automatically if you are transferring from Beat On.

First uninstall Beatsaber (and BMBF's old versions, to find them search the word `love` in the My apps tab and it should pop up as `We Love Oculus`,and then find and remove it's Wrapper, or Beat On if you have that still) in order to get a clean game for the newest BMBF to be able to patch properly. Any modifications to official games make them unable to update or uninstall naturally in headset so uninstall it in SideQuest's  my apps tab under the app settings icon (a Gear icon) to its right. Then just reinstall your game from the official Oculus store, 

After re-installation you NEED to run it to solo mode in game, this is so it can create certain files needed, Then close Beatsaber install BMBF to your PC to run it and install BMBF to your headset.

Also be sure after re-installation to buy/re download any packs you have or want in game BEFORE patching with BMBF,
Then install and run the BMBF installer from PC while connected, which can be downloaded from the below link and run it in headset from the Oculus TV  Channels subsection after it is done
.
