# All about BMBF the custom song installer for BeatSaber and installing it

## Beat On has long since been Discontinued, BMBF is what has replaced it, any error seen about Beat On is lingering code and can be ignored.

#### MAKE SURE TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL PAID FOR VERSION OF BEATSABER FROM THE OFFICIAL OCULUS QUEST STORE AND THAT PC SABERS AND MODS WILL NOT WORK ON THE QUEST

### Pirated copy's will not work in any capacity with BMBF nor will the Demo.

###### SideQuest is NOT responsible for BMBF, how it modifies BeatSaber or what it does and can not be held responsible for any issues that occur upon install be they from user error or from the program side, Know also that if a mod was obtained from Beastsaber or some external website and not from Quest built proper sources such as SideQuest its self or the [Redbrumbler Github](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/BMBFCustomSabers/tree/master/Sabers)  know they more then likely are NOT Quest saber.

`Note that BMBF is a standalone replacement for Beat On of which SideQuest no longer supports. to install it follow the steps below. BMBF tries to recover songs, save data and such all automatically if you are transferring from Beat On.`

### - Before Proceeding, Backup creation of Game data and Scores
----

First since you need to get a clean unmodded Beatsaber version installed and run it to Solo mode (as in open the game and enter solo mode) in order to to patch properly. If you care for your scores be sure to back them up in the SideQuests `My Apps` tab by clicking the settings button (Gear Icon) to the right of Beatsaber, Clicking Back Up Game Data then checking the `My Tasks` tab to make sure it is finished installing before you proceed.

## - To Uninstall Properly
----

Go to the `My Apps` manager tab in Sidequest and click the gear to the right of the application and click uninstall, you can do the same for BMBF's old version using SideQuests My apps tab by searching the word `love` in the My apps tab and it should pop up as `We Love Oculus`and uninstall it by clicking the gear icon to the right and clicking uninstall, Then find and remove the BMBF related `Wrapper` 
##### (Uninstall Beat On if you have that still)


###### `Note any modifications to official games make them unable to update or uninstall naturally in headset, You can uninstall them in SideQuest's  My apps tab under the app settings icon (a Gear icon) to its right. Then just reinstall your game from the official Oculus store.`


----

### - If you had Mods or Custom Songs installed before.
----

The system should automatically transfer songs and Mods up despite the program being uninstalled,
For purchased packs make sure however you install them to your base game prior to modding it with BMBF.

If they are not present try and go to the Tools tab in BMBF in PC or Headset and click Reload Song Folder, Then sync and launch the game and they should appear then.
If purchased packs still do not appear try to re install from scratch completely by deleting the BMBF folder feom your headset in the SideQuest explorer.

##### `WARNING IF DELETING THE BMBF FOLDER`

###### `Deleting the BMBF folder will mean ALL CUSOM SONGS AND MODS are completly wiped and will note be recoverable with anything in the BMBFs TOOL tab. They will all have to be reinstalled once again from where you got them originally, though songs can be recovered faster if you utilize the Syncsaber bookmark system after making an account on Beastsaber.com with this method mods will always need to always be manually recovered when doing this.`

### For Transferring up Purchased Packs and Save Data
----

Make sure to run SideQuest and back up your player data from Beatsabers Gear icon, then you can reload your save data from the My Apps tab and that the scores can be seen in the base game Prior to installing BMBF,
For Purchased Packs make sure you install them to your base game BEFORE modding it with BMBF so be sure after re-installation of a clean Beatsaber to buy/re download any packs you have or want in game prior to doing anything with BMBF, Then you can install and run the BMBF installer from PC while connected as normal

#### - Alternative ways to install Mods

So long as BMBF is properly installed SideQuest may be used to install mods from it's BMBF mod tab through a Cable of from Wireless mode if connected that way by clicking Install latest like any game, though some may be out dated or non functioning so be aware of the convenient `Reset assets` button within BMBFs tools tab


## - Updating Beatsaber before BMBF get's an update to match.

Something to be aware of is that when ever Beatsaber gets updates it usually (at least for a while) makes BMBF non functional for the updated version, so do not update right away if you care for your custom songs for importing custom songs and mods, Apologies but if you have updated and BMBF has stopped functioning there is little to be done, You can see if there is a backed up APK in the BMBF data backup folder in your device to recover to, if so be sure to uninstall Beatsaber first before using the backup, (usually called "donotuse" as an anti tamper measure) with the install APK button top right of SideQuest, Otherwise if you are new to BMBF and/or have no backup you will have to wait until the creators of BMBF are able to do some work to update BMBF and decided their work is ready to be released, until then the only thing to do is wait till they put out a new installer that is compatible with Beatsabers updated version to be able to be used and let you install custom songs once more,The time frame of which no one knows as each update is different.
