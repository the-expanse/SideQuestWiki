## BMBF is a custom song installer for BeatSaber 
#### Note that Beat On, the original custom song and mod installer for Beatsaber has long since been Discontinued and BMBF is what has replaced it.

For any assistance with Modding past BMBF join the beatsaber modding group Discord at
[BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)
Where are you can also obtain the mod extender, Some songs and more detailed mods require it else they will just permanently load in beatsaber or never activate.

### MAKE SURE TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL PAID FOR VERSION OF BEATSABER 
Pirated copy's or the beatsaber Demo will not work in any capacity with BMBF.


### If you have installed custom songs before
----

Make sure to reinstall BeatSaber fresh and uninstall BMBFs old version before you go any further if you have installed custom songs before as if you do not un and reinstall correctly many issues may arise upon updating or re-installation of BMBF.


## - Before Proceeding, Backup creation of Game data and Scores
----

If you care for your scores you can save and transfer them up, do so in the SideQuests currently installed Apps tab at the top right in SideQuest (Looks like a square of 9 smaller squares) then find beatsaber and click its setting button (Gear Icon) then click Back Up Game Data and let it back up, you can check the `My Tasks` tab to be sure it properly saved, your scores can then be recovered prior to running BMBF and letting it mod beatsaber from the same page you backed it up on by clicking the refresh icon (The icon with half moon arrows that point at each other) under "Backup game data" if you have more then one select the most recent date.

FOR SONGS
You can manage and install songs from in headset directly without a PC easily, just open BMBF from `Oculus TV`s channels Tab and go to the browser tab within it, then search the song you desire and click the download zip button, it looks like a down arrow.

FOR MODS
You can install Mods from within headset as well  by locating the globe web browser icon in the top-right of BMBF under the browser Tab, and clicking SideQuest,  then just click install latest on a mod you want, after that you can dismiss and re-enable the mod at will from the mods tab in BMBF.

# Song Bookmark system
----

You can use the built in bookmark system which helps save and import songs using any browser. Just create and/or log into a beastsaber account on your PC, Phone Tablet or what ever you have access to in a web browser, Find a song you like and click the bookmark icon on songs you want. You can then in headset open the the BMBF application under `Oculus TV` and open the syncsaber tab, put your user name into the text box and enable bookmarks by clicking it's switch on, then set bookmarks to infinite mode (set it to below zero) then you just click the sync button on the page and let them install, then your done.


## Managing or Installing Songs and Mods a PC or on mobile devices

You can get a song zip from `Beastsaber.com` or `beatsaver.com` (Not Mods as they are PC only), in your PC browser as long as you are on the same Wi-Fi connection type your Quests IP (Found top left of SideQuest when connected" followed by `:50000`, Be sure to type the IP properly in your browser on whatever device you are attempting to use then type `:50000` fully, it should open a page for BMBF management then, after that if on PC you can to the upload tab and install it there, make sure to always have BMBF open and running in headset when managing on other devices.
You can also use this meathod to install mod zip folders but that is ill advised as most are PC only and not compatible with the Quest so if not obtained Via SideQuests own list be wary
You can manage your playlists and even install songs from a phone or tablet  using the same IP from their browser  so long as the device and your Quest are on the same Wi-Fi network.

## - Alternative ways to install Mods or Songs

So long as BMBF is properly installed SideQuest may be used to install mods from it's BMBF mod tab or also you can directly add unzipped songs into the BMBF custom song folder via dragdrop files into your file explorer, the file path should be Quest>InternalStorage>BMBFdata>customsongs , you can do this either with either a Cable or using SideQuests Wireless mode, so long as it states it is connected they will install, you can also for mods just locate a mod you desire and install it by clicking Install latest like any game, though some may be out dated or non functioning so be aware of the convenient `Reset assets` button within BMBFs tools tab, Be aware any mods obtained externally from SideQuest more then likely are PC only such as those from BeastSaber.com
When ever manually adding mods or songs be sure to click "reload song folder" in BMBFs tools tab then you should see them appear.

## Disclaimers

`Note that BMBF is a standalone replacement for Beat On of which SideQuest no longer supports. to install it follow the steps below. BMBF tries to recover songs, save data and such all automatically if you are transferring from Beat On.`

###### SideQuest is NOT responsible for BMBF, how it modifies BeatSaber or what it does and can not be held responsible for any issues that occur upon install be they from user error or from the program side,

## Mods outside of SideQuest

if a mod was obtained from Beastsaber or some external website and not a mod built for the Quest or from proper sources such as SideQuest its self or the [Redbrumbler Github](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/BMBFCustomSabers/tree/master/Sabers)  know they more then likely are to be incompatible and PC only sabers.


## - If your updating have used BMBF before or have a faulty installation
----

#### Songs are safe even if the program is uninstalled but packs (how you organized them) are lost, after re-installation just open BMBF in headset, go to TOOLS and click it's `Reload song folder` button

Connect your headset to your PC and go to the `My Apps` manager tab locatable in SideQuests launchers top right management bar, then locate BMBF and Beatsaber using the search function click the gear to the right of the application and click uninstall, For BMBF search the word `love` in the My apps tab and it should pop up as `We Love Oculus` or something similar and uninstall the same way as BeatSaber, as well as the BMBF wrapper which is no longer needed.
##### (Uninstall Beat On if you have that still)


##### `Note any modifications to official games make them unable to update or uninstall naturally in headset, You can uninstall them in SideQuest's  My apps tab under the app settings icon (a Gear icon) to its right. Then just reinstall your game from the official Oculus store.` For how to uninstall apps and games that have been modified properly (Such as BMBF BeatSaber) [see here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Force-Uninstaller-for-SideQuest)

## -What happens to your old Purchased, Custom songs and mods if you are updating to BMBF from a previous version or from Beat On
----

The system should automatically transfer songs and Mods up despite the program being uninstalled as songs and mods are archived in a special folder so they will not be deleted without manual removed of it's folder by the user.For purchased packs make sure however you install them to your base game prior to modding it with BMBF.

If they are not present try and go to the Tools tab in BMBF in PC or Headset and click Reload Song Folder, Then sync and launch the game and they should appear then.If purchased packs still do not appear try to re install from scratch completely by 
 deleting the BMBF folder from your headset in the SideQuest explorer.

## - If BeatSaber Permaloads or BMBF won't let you sync
----

If this occurs be sure to check in your main library click the 3 dot button on Beatsabers game icon, then go to Permissions and turn allow Storage permissions for the game, if the issue persists then restart your device and it should subside, 
If it continues try dis and re enabling the storage permissions and hard restart your headset by holding the power button for 15 seconds, if it still persists it would be best to clean install following the directions below from scratch, make sure to remove all related programs (Beatsaber, BMBF, BeatOn) before installing Beatsaber again and starting the process.


##### `WARNING IF DELETING THE BMBF FOLDER`

###### `Deleting the BMBF folder will mean ALL CUSOM SONGS AND MODS are completly wiped and will note be recoverable with anything in the BMBFs TOOL tab. They will all have to be reinstalled once again from where you got them originally, though songs can be recovered faster if you utilize the Syncsaber bookmark system after making an account on Beastsaber.com 
with this method mods will always need to always be manually recovered when doing this.`

## For Transferring up Purchased Packs and Save Data
----

Make sure to run SideQuest and back up your player data from Beatsabers Gear icon, then you can reload your save data from the My Apps tab and that the scores can be seen in the base game Prior to installing BMBF, For Purchased Packs make sure restart the headset entirely by powering it off for at least 5 seconds then back on, then you can install them to your base game BEFORE modding it with BMBF so be sure after re-installation of a clean Beatsaber to buy/re download any packs you have or want in game prior to doing anything with BMBF, Then you can install and run the BMBF installer from PC while connected as normal


# - Updating Beatsaber before BMBF get's an update to match.

Something to be aware of is that when ever Beatsaber gets updates it usually (at least for a while) makes BMBF non functional for the updated version, so do not update right away if you care for your custom songs for importing custom songs and 
mods, Apologies but if you have updated and BMBF has stopped functioning there is little to be done, You can see if there is a backed up APK in the BMBF data backup folder in your device to recover to, if so be sure to uninstall Beatsaber first 
before using the backup, (usually called "donotuse" as an anti tamper measure) with the install APK button top right of SideQuest, Otherwise if you are new to BMBF and/or have no backup you will have to wait until the creators of BMBF are able to do some work to update BMBF and decided their work is ready to be released, until then the only thing to do is wait till they put out a new installer that is compatible with Beatsabers updated version to be able to be used and let you install custom songs once more,The time frame of which no one knows as each update is different.
