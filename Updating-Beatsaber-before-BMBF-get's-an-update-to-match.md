Something to be aware of is that when ever Beatsaber gets updates it usually (at least for a while) makes BMBF non functional for the updated version, so do not update right away if you care for your custom songs for importing custom songs and 
mods, Apologies but if you have updated and BMBF has stopped functioning there is little to be done, You can see if there is a backed up APK in the BMBF data backup folder in your device to recover to, if so be sure to uninstall Beatsaber first 
before using the backup, (usually called "donotuse" as an anti tamper measure) with the install APK button top right of SideQuest, Otherwise if you are new to BMBF and/or have no backup you will have to wait until the creators of BMBF are able to do some work to update BMBF and decided their work is ready to be released, until then the only thing to do is wait till they put out a new installer that is compatible with Beatsabers updated version to be able to be used and let you install custom songs once more,The time frame of which no one knows as each update is different.
