Something to be aware of is that when ever Beatsaber gets updates it usually (at least for a while) makes BMBF non functional for the updated version, so do not update right away if you can help it and care more for your custom songs, If you have updated and BMBF has stopped functioning there is little to be done if you did not back up your game data and APK prior to the update, You can see if there is a backed up APK in the BMBF data backup folder wiin your device to recover to and dragdrop or click `Install APK from file folder` top right of SideQuest if there is., if so be sure to uninstall Beatsaber first before using the backup, (usually called "donotuse" as an anti tamper measure) Otherwise if you are new to BMBF and/or have no backup you will have to wait until the creators of BMBF are able to update BMBF, Until then the only thing otherwise to do is wait and enjoy base Beatsaber and it's songs until they put out a new version that is compatible with Beatsabers update to be able to install custom songs and mods once more, The time frame of which no one knows as each update is different.
