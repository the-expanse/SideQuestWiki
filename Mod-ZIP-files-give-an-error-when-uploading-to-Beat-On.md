Be aware that PC mods are NOT compatible with Quest at this time

If you're having issues installing a skin or MOD from SideQuests Mods tab try going to it's GitHub URL or alternative version of the Mod or Song and installing the ZIP to your PC before you head back to to BeatOn's Upload tab in SideQuest, then try clicking on the white Upload button and selecting the file you want to upload from your PC in your file explorer manually instead of dragging and dropping it, that some times fixes the issue.

When manually installing Mods not From SideQuests MOD tab sometimes when you download a ZIP file and click the stack it auto extracts causing issues and as Beat On only recognizes ZIP folders, so be sure to just open a finder window and navigate to your download folder to use the proper base ZIP folder If you downloaded it from your normal browser, otherwise if you just install them right from SideQuests Mods tab there should be little issue.
