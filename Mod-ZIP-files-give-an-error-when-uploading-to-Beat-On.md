Be aware that PC mods are NOT compatible with Quest at this time
----
.Saber files are not currently supported and need to be converted by a modder manually before they can work at all so make sure to try and only use sabers you find in SideQuest it's self where you can if possible, but if a mod you want is supported for SideQuest and not upon SideQuests MODS tab there are a few things you can try, First off if you're having issues installing a SaberSkin or MOD from SideQuests Mods tab try to restart SideQuest and try again, else check [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/The-Queue-System), however if it is a proper ZIP folder and you are sure it is supported and has been modded for Quest, try going to it's GitHub URL directly or locate an alternative version of the Mod or Song ZIP and install the ZIP to your PC before you head to BeatOn's Upload tab in SideQuest and hit the white Upload button, then try selecting the file you want to upload from your PC in your file explorer manually instead of dragging and dropping it, that some times fixes the issue.

When manually installing Mods not From SideQuests MOD tab sometimes when you download a ZIP file and click the stack it auto extracts causing issues and as Beat On only recognizes ZIP folders, so be sure to just open a finder window and navigate to your download folder to use the proper base ZIP folder If you downloaded it from your normal browser, otherwise if you just install them right from SideQuests Mods tab there should be little issue.
