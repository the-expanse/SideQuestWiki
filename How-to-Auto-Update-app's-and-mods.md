If you have created an account after already installing other applications, Most applications will not appear in your `DASHBOARD` the way to correct this is to just Uninstalled them Via SideQuests `Current Apps` tab to get shown when the application has been updated, but they only need to be uninstalled and redownloaded once, From then on it will then be able to detect and check them from then for updates on the fly from your `DASHBOARD` from any device,
enjoy the new convenience of the DASHBOARD
