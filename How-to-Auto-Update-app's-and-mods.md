Also note that if you have created an account, but had already installed other applications before making or logging into your account in SideQuest, Most applications may not appear in your `DASHBOARD` the way to correct this is to just Uninstalled them Via SideQuests `Current Apps` tab

Then reinstall them as normal, They only need to be Un- then reinstalled once, they will then get shown in your `DASHBOARD` and have an icon when the application has been updated as it will be able to detect and check each application for updates from their developers on the fly, you can look to see weather or not you have an app that needs to be updated in your `DASHBOARD` from any device you are logged into [SideQuestVR.com](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account) from, but you can only install them when directly connected to SideQuest on your PC.
