To use this feature you must first create a SideQuest account at [www.SideQuestVR.com](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account) after that you can remotely install or update applications to your Ques headset so long as it is connected to a valid SideQuest version on a computer. Your headset must be connected to SideQuest either with [Wireless mode](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Menu-UI) or directly with a USB cable to the computer and that launcher must be logged into your account to receive the Queue request to start installation of the chosen application. After meeting the requirements above you can install or update any application hosted on our system by going to SideQuestVR.com, logging into your account, locating an application and clicking install latest from anywhere on any device, even another computer at a distance that does not have SideQuest installed on it, This can also be done on a phone.

###### Remote Installation is not a feature for installing things in the headset to the headset.

To be clear users who want to use this feature still need to have their headset connected to a computer some how, SideQuest must state it is connected to a headset and a valid SideQuest user account must be created and logged into on the PC launcher the headset is connected with, the headset must be connected to SideQuest as usual but after that is done you can initiate a games installation any other device at any distance on our website.
