To use this feature you must first create a SideQuest account at [www.SideQuestVR.com](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account) after that you can remotely install or update applications to your Ques headset so long as it is connected to a valid SideQuest version on a computer. Your headset must be connected to SideQuest either with [Wireless mode](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Menu-UI) or directly with a USB cable to the computer and that launcher must be logged into your account to receive the Queue request to start installation of the chosen application. After meeting the requirements above you can install or update any application hosted on our system by going to SideQuestVR.com, logging into your account, locating an application and clicking install latest from anywhere on any device, even another computer at a distance that does not have SideQuest installed on it, This can also be done on a phone.

###### Remote Installation is not a feature for installing things in the headset to the headset, you still need to have your headset connected to a computer you can just now use SideQuest to install games from a distance so long as your headset is connected to the launcher at home or to another valid computer with SideQuest installed and running, This system is for when a user is away from their headset and want to check or install a new game or and update to a game you have installed already who left their computer on, SideQuest on and their headset connected somehow to their computer making the device still connected to and manageable with SideQuest. It works by sending a command through the internet to your SideQuest launcher on your PC with a logged in SideQuest account.
