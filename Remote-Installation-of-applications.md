# Remote Installation
###### This is not a feature for installing things in the headset to the headset.

To use this feature you must first create a SideQuest account at [www.SideQuestvr.com](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account) after that you can remotely install or update applications to your Quest headset so long as it is connected to a valid SideQuest version on a computer. Your headset must be connected to SideQuest either with [Wireless mode](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Menu-UI) or directly with a USB cable to the computer and that launcher must be logged into your account to receive the Queue request to start installation of the chosen application. After meeting the requirements above you can install or update any application hosted on our system by going to [www.SideQuestvr.com](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account), logging into your account, locating an application and clicking install latest from anywhere on any device, even another computer at a distance that does not have SideQuest installed on it, This can also be done on a phone, you can if connected on your PC also install things while in headset by going to [www.SideQuestvr.com](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account) and logging into your account on its native browser.

##### To be clear, users who want to use this feature still need to have their headset connected to a computer somehow as always. SideQuest still must state it is connected to a headset, the only difference is a valid SideQuest user account must be created and logged into on the PC launcher the headset is connected with. Otherwise, the headset is connected to SideQuest as usual but after that is done you can initiate a game's installation any other device at any distance on our website by logging into your SideQuest account and using our website like it was the launcher page.
