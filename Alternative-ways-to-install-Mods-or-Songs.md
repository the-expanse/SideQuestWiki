So long as BMBF is properly installed SideQuest may be used to install mods from it's BMBF mod tab or also you can directly add unzipped songs into the BMBF custom song folder via dragdrop files into your file explorer, the file path should be Quest>InternalStorage>BMBFdata>customsongs , you can do this either with either a Cable or using SideQuests Wireless mode, so long as it states it is connected they will install, you can also for mods just locate a mod you desire and install it by clicking Install latest like any game, though some may be out dated or non functioning so be aware of the convenient `Reset assets` button within BMBFs tools tab, Be aware any mods obtained externally from SideQuest more then likely are PC only such as those from BeastSaber.com
When ever manually adding mods or songs be sure to click "reload song folder" in BMBFs tools tab then you should see them appear.
