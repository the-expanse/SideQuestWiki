Bluestacks is quite a pain to remove if it is causing issues, to do so just follow the steps below and try to reboot your PC before reopening SideQuest,


Go to C:\ProgramData (Note: The folder will be hidden so unhide the folders) and delete BlueStacks Setup folder from there.

then open the Run system (Windows + R) and 
Run %temp% command, then delete all temporary files in the temp folder.

Finally we will remove BlueStacks registry files from Registry editor. For this write regedit in the Run box (Windows + R). And then navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BlueStacks Select all keys within it and delete them
