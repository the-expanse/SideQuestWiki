### Supported Devices

The Oculus Quest is the only fully supported device by SideQuest currently and requires a Computer to install applications and games from SideQuest to a headset, Both the Oculus GO and Google Cardboard can be used as well but has limitations, SideQuest is NOT an application that is installed onto the Quest device its self.
The Oculus GO is not entirely properly supported and we can do little to help if you have any issues installing apps to a Oculus GO but there are a few inbuilt systems to accommodate installing GO game APKs.

### Non-Supported Devices

**Non-supported devices or devices we can not help with are as follows, Chromebooks, Windows-32Bit, Windows-7, Windows-8 Tablets, Nintendo Labo, Vive, Rift/Rift-S, GearVR and Index**

### Why are these devices unsupported by SideQuest
Any non Standalone, Non-Android, VR capable devices are unsupported due to how they are made for PC and do not register APKs in any conceivable way, APKs are a specialized format of file made for Android and like trying to run a Windows game on a Mac PC it will not function if installed or ran without ludicrous measures and layers of other programs, PCVR only headsets unaffiliated with android as SideQuest can not install an APK (Android Application Package) to a Computer.**

###### `Note once again a PC is required to install programs with SideQuest but SideQuest uses the PC to install the APKs directly into your headset as a through put, Phones are capable of installing APKs to a headset but it is not recommended, for about how to do that click` [here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Installing-with-a-Mobile-Phone),` they only support normal APKs. Always be wary of viruses if attempting to install anything from outside SideQuest as we can likely not assist if something goes wrong with an application or game not on our system.`
