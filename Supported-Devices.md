### Supported Devices for device installation
##### (Games under the PCVR section on SideQuestVR.com and in the SideQuest application are excluded from certain device restrictions, Such Headsets as the Valve Index and HTC Vive are immune however the PC Operating System installation requirements stand for all devices)

The Oculus Quest as a headset is the only fully supported VR device to SideQuest currently and to use it requires a Computer to install applications and games from SideQuest to the headset.
Both the Oculus GO and Google Cardboard can be used as well but has limitations, SideQuest is NOT an application that is installed onto the Quest device its self. The Oculus GO is not entirely properly supported and we can do little to help if you have any issues installing apps to a Oculus GO but there are a few inbuilt systems to accommodate installing GO game APKs.

### Why are these devices unsupported by SideQuest

Windows 7/8 do not work anymore due to an update from Oculus with their drivers we can do nothing about, past that any Non-Standalone, Non-Android, VR capable devices are unsupported due to how they are made for PC and do not register APKs in any conceivable way, APKs are a specialized format of file made for Android and like trying to run a Windows game on a Mac PC it will not function if installed or ran without ludicrous measures and layers of other programs, PCVR only headsets unaffiliated with android as SideQuest can not install an APK (Android Application Package) to a Computer.**

###### `Note once again a PC is required to install programs with SideQuest but SideQuest uses the PC to install the APKs directly into your headset as a through put, Phones are capable of installing APKs to a headset but it is not recommended, for about how to do that click` [here](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Installing-with-a-Mobile-Phone),` they only support normal APKs. Always be wary of viruses if attempting to install anything from outside SideQuest as we can likely not assist if something goes wrong with an application or game not on our system.`
