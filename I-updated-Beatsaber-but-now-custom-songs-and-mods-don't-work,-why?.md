Directly after a BeatSaber update Beat On is not equipped to deal with the change in file structure or how the new APK works, so updating your game will tend to break Beat On's ability to modify your game at all, due to this it is highly suggested to refrain from updating until Beat On obtains it's own update, if you have updated already but have made a proper backup, if you have then uninstall BeatSaber before you then follow the simple steps below, if you have not made a backup, meaning there is no APK file in the folder you will have to wait for Beat On to update.

Locate your local Beatsaber Backups

then proceed to drag the APK into SideQuest here

After it is installed, reset your headset and run beat on to make sure it works properly, else run quick fix in Beat Ons settings and try again, beyond that if it fails it would be best to await a Beat On update, uninstall BeatSaber and just update your game, and play the vanilla songs until BeatOn is running once again, you can check for updates in your user DASHBOARD within SideQuest when logged in, as shown below

Alternatively Beat On has it's own backup system, you can locate a backup of the last APK it was functional with here

Just use that instead if you have not made a local backup to SideQuest
