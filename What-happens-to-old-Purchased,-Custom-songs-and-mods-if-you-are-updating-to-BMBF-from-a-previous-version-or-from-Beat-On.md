The system should automatically transfer songs and Mods up despite the program being uninstalled as songs and mods are archived in a special folder so they will not be deleted without manual removed of it's folder by the user.For purchased packs make sure however you install them to your base game prior to modding it with BMBF.

If they are not present try and go to the Tools tab in BMBF in PC or Headset and click Reload Song Folder, Then sync and launch the game and they should appear then.If purchased packs still do not appear try to re install from scratch completely by deleting the BMBF folder from your headset in the SideQuest explorer.
