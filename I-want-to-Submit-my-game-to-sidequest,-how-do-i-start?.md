You can sign up [here](https://sidequestvr.com/#/sign-up)

Then just enable developer mode and set up your application with the github release system to auto roll out the latest version, after sending it in the first time it will be checked to make sure it works and approved. It will appear live in SideQuest moments after to start being installed by users. 

Connect with me on [discord](https://discord.gg/hzCf9Vj) and ask the the `AD` role to get access to resources and feedback options on the developer process.
