What Beat On Is
----
Beat On is an additional program for Beatsaber that makes custom song and Mod management both possible to install and use, as well as making doing so much more streamlined, allowing you to install Beatsaber songs from right inside your headset OR from your PC, while also allowing you to install new swords skins, wall colors and other various game modifications from a growing list in SideQuests [![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/608376262347587595/610263775584714773/Screenshot_1199.png)](https://sidequestvr.com/#/apps/4),

After installation of Side Quest if you do not have a [2D launcher](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/199) installed into your headset, Beat On will only appear in OculusTV, Make sure Beat On is open in headset when you want to use any Beat On features from your PC in SideQuest you can once again find it in OculusTV, or in the 2D APP launcher found in unknown sources.
