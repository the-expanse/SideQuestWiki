Essentially Beat On is an additional program for Beatsaber that makes custom song and Mod management both possible as well as much more streamlined and allows you to install Beatsaber songs from right inside your headset, while also allowing you to install new swords skins, wall colors and other various game modifications from a growing list in Sidequests MODs tab, after installation if you do not have Sidequests [2D launcher](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/90) it should only appear in Oculus TV, make sure Beat On is open in headset when you want to use any Beat On features from your PC in SideQuest, for any more information feel free to watch the video
