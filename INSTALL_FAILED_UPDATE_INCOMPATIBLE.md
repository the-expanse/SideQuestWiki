Generally this error occurs only if there is a previous, old or corrupted version of the application the system is being asked to install, the usual solution is to go to your "My Apps" application manager tab in SideQuest under the top right drop down bar, locate the related application and uninstall it by clicking the gear icon to the right of it in the page, then to attempt reinstall the application again, some applications such as Pavlov and Crisis VRgade are quite large and take a while and may not properly install the first time, if after re-installation you still have issues try to fully power off the headset and re power it before launching the application once again and if that fails try visiting our Discord at https://discord.me/sidequestvr to ask for direct help in the support section, someone may be able to assist you there.
