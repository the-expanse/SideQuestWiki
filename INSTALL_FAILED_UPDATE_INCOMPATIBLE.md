Generally this error occurs only if there is a previous, old or corrupted version of the application the system is being asked to install, The usual solution is to go to your "My Apps" application manager tab in SideQuest under the top right of SideQuest in the menu bar and select the 9 square icon

gear icon right of the application in the page, after installation restart your headset and attempt reinstallation the application again, some applications such as Pavlov and Crisis VRgade are quite large and take a while and may not properly install the first time, if after re-installation you still have issues try to fully power off the headset and re power it before launching the application, else try to install the application with either a different cable and USB port (preferably not 3.0) or using Wireless mode over your Wi-Fi Router for a possibly more consistent connection once again.

if all else fails try visiting our Discord at https://discord.me/sidequestvr to ask for direct assistance in the support chat section, someone may be able to assist you there.
