If you see something like below

Sometimes a unstable connection causes songs to skip, or the installer messes up asking or receiving the song,

The system will Auto retry after 30 seconds or so on it's own and that should get it to install fine, but if not
all you should need to do is click `retry failed` and everything should go through fine as depicted below

if a song continues to fail try restarting SideQuest and make sure Beat On is properly installed and enabled [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Beat-On,-What-is-that%3F)

if the song continues to error beyond those instructions, the song itself may be in error or have been created improperly by the songs mapper somehow so it is best to surrender and look for an alternative version, or give up and find a different song.
