Sometimes a unstable connection causes songs to skip, or the installer messes up asking or receiving the song
all you need to do is click `retry failed` and everything should go through fine as depicted below

if a song continues to fail try restarting SideQuest and make sure Beat On is properly installed and enabled [HERE](https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuest/wiki/Beat-On,-What-is-that%3F)

if the song continues to error beyond those instructions, the song itself may be in error or have been created inproperly by the songs mapper some how so it is best to surrender and look for an alternative version, or give up and find a different song
