You absolutely can, 
just go to the APPs tab in sidequest and under App settings (the gear icon to the very right beatsaber) click Backup Game Data in Beatsabers, this saves your scores and such, then uninstall Beatsaber with the Uninstall button, back out and uninstall Beat On, after reinstalling Beatsaber and Beat On and syncing your beat on songs back from Beat on in headset under Oculus TV, you can retrieve your player data by going back into the app settings once more (the gear icon) and reinstall them with the refresh icon to the utmost left of the save, your playlist and songs will be restored automatically upon launch of Beat On after reinstalling it and Beatsaber, then you should be set, 

if you don't see the (save game data button) and only see (Save SD card data) you are on an old version of Sidequest, be sure to update [Here](https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto), if there are any issues afterwards try heading to Beat On in your headset under Oculus TV and go to tools to try clicking "QuickFix", if issues continue to persist join the [Discord](https://discord.me/sidequestvr) and ask around, someone there may be able to assist you
