then proceed to reinstall Beatsaber from the oculus store and Beat On from [Here](https://sidequestvr.com/#/app/14) 


After reinstalling everything go into your headset and head to under Oculus TV, scroll down and Open Beat On then let it patch your Beatsaber game once more, your playlist and songs will ask to be restored automatically upon launch of Beat On after reinstalling it and Beatsaber.

when Beat On is done patching Beatsaber you can then retrieve your player data from here

your playlist and songs will ask to be restored automatically upon launch of Beat On after reinstalling it and Beatsaber, then you should be set, 

if you don't see the (save game data button) and only see (Save SD card data) you are on an old version of Sidequest, be sure to update SideQuest from [Here](https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto), if there are any issues afterwards make sure to try heading to Beat On in your headset under Oculus TV again  and go to tools to try clicking "QuickFix", 

if issues continue to persist join the [Discord](https://discord.me/sidequestvr) and ask around, someone there may be able to assist you
