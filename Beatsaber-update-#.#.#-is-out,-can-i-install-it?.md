yes, you absolutely can just uninstall Beatsaber with Sidequest under APPs after clicking Backup Game Data in Beatsabers appsettings (the gear icon) and reinstall it, do the same with beat on weather or not it is out of date as well else some conflicts arise, your playlist and songs will be restored automatically you need only to uninstall it from the same place as Beatsaber before reinstalling it as well, then you should be set, if there are any issues afterwards try heading to Beat On in your headset and go to tools and clicking "QuickFix", if issues continue to persist join the [Discord](https://discord.me/sidequestvr) and ask around, someone there may be able to assist you
