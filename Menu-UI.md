Home brings you to the default page SideQuest starts on.

Back Takes you to the precious page.

Web Browser is where you can type in any URL and use SideQuests web browser function, this can be used to for example to use Discord within SideQuest or install Beastsaber songs for BMBF or Mods, there are also Default links you can choose from below when in the URL popup.

Stream lets you connect your headset physically and stream video from in headset using SideQuest and ScrCpy, it has a few settings as well to tinker with such as the Bitrate and Crop amount, audio is not supported however and will require external hardware such as Bluetooth Transmitters and receivers or a cable.

Wireless mode's icon only appears when connected via cable and will let you install games apps and manage your in headset recordings and folders all without a cable when enabled, it will need to be reconnected upon reboot of your Heaset or PC but should persist if SideQuest it's self is closed and reopened and be able to be connected again without needing a cord again.
