Mods are bits of code you can install to change or add more to your game or app, for example Custom Saber skins that change your beat sabers to Katanas or axes, or score saber to help you see better how your playing.

To enable and disable Mods you have installed from Beat On in headset, just open Beat On from OculusTV/SideQuest-TV and open Mods in there, after doing so sync to BeatSaber and launch the game, you now should have mods when playing songs., Some MODS may give a warning they may not work, if so just click continue and try them, if they fail you can disable them, click the trashcan icon top right of them to uninstall them, then head to beat ons `TOOLS` tab and hit `reset assets` then `recover song folder` to get back your songs and mods, your songs will appear in the right side of the playlist though so be warned if you have a lot of songs that if a mod bugs your game you may have to re sort manually once more, but when ever a mod fails or bugs your game just hit `Reset` then `recover songs` and it should fix the issue then delete the offending mod to prevent any further problems
