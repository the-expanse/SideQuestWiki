# Welcome to SafeSide

What is "SafeSide"
----
We welcome you to SafeSide, Our self coded archive system created to have a firewall system against piracy and virus's, We have put a lot of time and effort into the system getting it into place out of necessity and in order to prevent installation of dangerous or illegal content against the Oculus ToS (or Terms Of Service) for the good of all SideQuest users and our own safety, there is no "off" switch or continue anyways button, Though if you find an APK that should be considered safe you can report it as incorrectly flagged in error. We can not assist in any way with piracy of any sort and will not be associated with any such practices or programs appologies. See below for more information.

Why am I seeing a SafeSide error
----
If you see an error or a SafeSide page upon installing an APK it is registered as being harmful or illegitimate content and will not be allowed to install with SideQuest any more, the continue anyway button has been removed for this reason. All old versions of SideQuest are rendered essentially offline and inoperable properly.

My application is self-made or free and legitimate, what do I do to fix it?
----
If you have received this pop-up in error and are not attempting to install pirated or illegal content then you can attempt to and have bought a game from Itch.IO ake sure you install it using the SideQuest launcher not in a browser, if you have issues past that.
leave an issue at https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuestWebsite/issues/new including information and contact information about the APK, so we can speak about a possible inspection of it, if deemed a mistake we will be delighted to make an addition to a whitelist, Please know have virtual realitys best interest at heart and hope you understand.
