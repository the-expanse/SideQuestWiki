## Welcome SideQuests SafeSide security system

What is "SafeSide"
----

We welcome you to SafeSide, the self coded archive system we have created in an attempt to have a firewall system against piracy and virus's, We have put this system into place out of necessity in order to prevent installation of dangerous or illegal content for the good of all SideQuest users. 

Why am i seeing a SafeSide error
----

If you see an error or a SafeSide page upon installing an APK it is registered as being harmful or illegitimate content and will not be allowed to install with SideQuest properly. All old versions of SideQuest should be offline and inoperable properly and it is suggested you update to be able to properly utilize SideQuest.

My application is self made or free and legitimate, what do i do to fix it?

If you have received this pop-up in error and are not attempting to install pirated or illegal content then you can attempt to leave an issue at https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuestWebsite/issues/new including information and contact information about the APK so we can speak about a possible inspection of it, if deemed a mistake we will be delighted to make an addition to a whitelist, Please know have VRs best interest at heart and hope you understand.
