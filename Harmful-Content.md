## Welcome to the SafeSide

If you see an error or a SafeSide page upon installing an APK it is registered as being harmful content and will not be able to install with SideQuest properly. we welcome you to SafeSide the self coded archive system we have created in an attempt to have a firewall system against piracy and virus's, we have put this system into place out of necessity in order to prevent installation of dangerous or illegal content for the good of all SideQuest users. All old versions of SideQuest should be offline and inoperable properly and it is suggested you update to be able to properly utilize SideQuest.

If you have received this pop-up in error and are not attempting to install pirated or illegal content then you can attempt to leave an issue at https://github.com/the-expanse/SideQuestWebsite/issues/new including information about the APK and a link for inspection and addition to a whitelist, We have VRs best interest at heart and hope you understand.
