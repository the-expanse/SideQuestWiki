Wonderful they are quite fun to both make and use
RedBrumbler and Rugtveit have been kind enough to make a guide in an attempt to make it as simple as possible tp get started making your own saber as well as install others thanks to how they have created a centralized area to upload them for easy scanning and searching of Beatsaber Sword skins, just go to
 https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/ccg0bi/custom_saber_making_guide/


if you wish to upload your skin, or install some one else's go to 
https://github.com/RedBrumbler/BeatOnCustomSabers/tree/SaberSubmit/Sabers

Then click create a new file, name it your Discord/reddit user name and open it, then click Upload Files to upload the skin ZIP to the list of currently available and functioning Beatsaber Saberskins, any other direct downloads or sabers/mod may be found in the #mods chat

When installing mods or zip files with beat on in the upload page

Sometimes you have to drag and drop the zip file outside of the white upload box, it sometimes works better so give that a try if you're having issues installing a skin or mod with Beat On, if that fails try clicking on the white Upload button in Beat On and selecting the file you want to upload from your PC in your file explorer.

                                                   FOR MAC USERS ONLY

When you download the zip file and click it in the stack, it auto extracts, as Beat On currently only recognizes zip files be sure to,
(If you downloaded it from your normal browser)
just open a finder window and navigate to your download folder to use the proper base ZIP folder.
