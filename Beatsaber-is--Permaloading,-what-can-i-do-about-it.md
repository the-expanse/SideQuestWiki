Loading screen, try clearing your games "App data" in SideQuests app management (Square of 9 squares) tab in the Beatsaber settings (Gear icon) and uninstalling it before restarting your headset first before anything and reopen Beatsaber then clean reinstalling it and running it before trying to install and run the most recent BMBF in headset again to repatch it and reinstall your mods and songs.

If the issue persists double check you have given it storage permission by going to your library in headset and clicking the 3 dot icon on Beatsabers icon, then locating and allowing storage permissions, then reboot your headset and try again.
Failing that you can attempt to Uninstall

then Reinstall Beatsaber now that it has permissions properly before you restore your songs and mods from BMBFs Tools tab under `Reload Song folder` , it may ask to reinstall mods automatically when you open BMBF in headset under Oculus TV on reinstall but if it does so it is suggested to click no as it causes some issues some times.
Then in Headset under BMBFs TOOLS tab you can click the "Reload song folders" button to force restore them your songs and old mods.
