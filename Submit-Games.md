if you desire to Submit a game to sidequest,

You can sign up [here](https://sidequestvr.com/#/sign-up)

Then after creating one, or if you already have just go to [Your Account](https://sidequestvr.com/#/account) , enable developer mode and set up your application with the github release system to auto roll out the latest version, before sending it in make sure the URL is proper, after being confirmed it will be approved and will appear live in SideQuest moments after to start being installed by users, make POSITIVE the GitHub URL is the proper link and functioning before submitting for official approval, else no one will be able to utilize your mod or application.

You can add all sorts of social/donate/info links with the App Urls section. If you don't want to use github releases then the App Url of type `APK` can be used if it is a direct download url. When the version code is incremented that triggers automatic update notifications for users - which happens automatically with github releases. For more info on github releases click the "github how to" button in the github release section. 

You can also create events to promote your app! And if you want to be featured just ping me on discord.

Connect with me on [discord](https://discord.gg/hzCf9Vj) and ask for the `AD` (App Developer) role to get access to resources and feedback options on the developer process.
