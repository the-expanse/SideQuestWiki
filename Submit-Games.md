if you desire to Submit a game to sidequest,

You can sign up [here](https://sidequestvr.com/#/sign-up)

Then just enable developer mode and set up your application with the github release system to auto roll out the latest version, after sending it in the first time it will be checked to make sure it works and approved. It will appear live in SideQuest moments after to start being installed by users. , make POSITIVE the GitHub URL is the proper link and functioning before submitting for official approval, else no one will be able to utilize your mod or application.


Connect with the creator of SideQuest on [discord](https://discord.gg/hzCf9Vj) and ask for the `AD` role to get access to resources and feedback options on the developer process.
