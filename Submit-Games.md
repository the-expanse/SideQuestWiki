You can then add App urls or use github releases to add a download option for your app here

as well as add screenshots and a video to promote your work, the last screenshot put in will be used for the decorative parallax banner at the top but will be hidden if there are no screenshots. 

With the github release system it will auto roll out the latest version automatically when you upload a new version to it's designated Github link, but this will only work if the link is correct, so before sending it in make sure the URL is proper, after being confirmed it will be approved and will appear live in SideQuest moments after to start being installed by users, again please do make sure the GitHub URL is the proper link and functioning before submitting for official approval, else no one will be able to utilize your hard worked on mod or application.

You can also add all sorts of social/donate/info links with the App Urls section.

If you don't wish to use the built in github autorelease system and manually have the install be a static direct download URL then use the App Url `APK` type. When the version code is incremented that triggers automatic update notifications for users - which happens automatically with github releases. For more info on github releases click the "github how to" button in the github release section. 

You can also now create events to attract users and to promote your app Via the Dashboard
