There is a built in installer for the Pavlov, just unzip the Pavlov folder and use the "Install batch" in the Pavlov folder, make sure you are using the newest version else some errors such as only one hand at a time, and visual glitching may occur, just use the Install.Bat file while Sidequest is open and your headset is connected, a CMD will run and install it automatically then so wait till it finishes, then close sidequest and open the game in headset under Oculus TV, or unknown sources, if you have issues beyond that click [Here](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB) as Pavlov has a wonderful server that we are sure would be delighted to assist with any issues you may be experiencing, feel free to pop in and ask for help from the pros of Pavlov or voice any concerns about Pavlov to them
