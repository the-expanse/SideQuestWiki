## Note that SideQuest, the Expense and it's affiliates can not be held responsible for or maintain troubleshooting support with Pavlov as it will soon be on the official Oculus Store so anything beyond the below is out of our hands and updates to this how to will be few to non existent if they become outdated.


### Mac users will also need to go to the  [PAVLOV DISCORD](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB) for direct instructions as this is a Windows only guide


### Make sure you have the most recent Folder for PavLov from the [PAVLOV DISCORD](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB), that is usually an issue people overlook so be sure uninstall the old version from SideQuests Apps tab if you have it installed already before you download and unzip the newest Pavlov folder.

### Then just delete the Zip folder and go into to the new unzipped folder and open it

### Then just use the built in installer for the Pavlov from the new Extracted folder,                                               
## DO NOT drag and drop the files into SideQuest, also  and use the "Install.bat" located below

### It may not have (.bat) at the end but it is the same thing, also again make sure you are using the newest version, else some errors may occur, such as only one hand working at a time and visual glitching, after using the Install.Bat file while SideQuest is open and your headset is connected, a CMD will run and install it automatically so wait till it finishes, then close SideQuest and open the game in headset under Oculus TV or Unknown Sources, it will take some time to load for it's initialization boot so wait 5 or so minutes.


## if you have issues beyond that you can go to the [PAVLOV DISCORD](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB) , that will take you to their official Discord where you can ask for further and more in depth assistance, they have a wonderful server that we are sure would be delighted to help with any issues you may be experiencing, feel free to head there and ask for help from the pros of Pavlov and voice any concerns to them.
