#### Pavlov is NOT supported by SideQuest as it will be officially purchasable Via the Oculus app store in the future.

And the following is all we know and can provide, For any issues or further help installing Pavlov on Mac or otherwise see the  [OFFICIAL PAVLOV DISCORD SERVER](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB) for direct instructions 
also Pavlov, beyond that this is a simple Windows only guide and is the most support we can provide in the matter


Also do make sure you have the most recent Folder for PavLov from the [OFFICIAL PAVLOV DISCORD SERVER](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB)

that is usually an issue people overlook, Be sure uninstall the old version from SideQuests "My Apps" tab if you have had PavLov installed already prior to you downloading and unzipping the newest Pavlov folder for installation.

Then delete the Zip folder you extracted from to make the new folder, before you open the new unzipped folder

Then just use the built in installer for the Pavlov from the new Extracted folder,                                               
DO NOT drag and drop the files into SideQuest, also  and use the "Install.bat" located below

It may or may not have (.bat) at the end but it is the same, just run that while sidequest is running and connected to your headset, a window will then pop up and run some installation code, let that run adn when finished click enter, also again make sure you are using the newest version of the Pavlov installer, else some errors may occur, such as only one hand working at a time and visual glitching, after using the Install.Bat file, after it finishes close SideQuest and reboot your headset, then open the game in Headset under Unknown Sources or Oculus TV if it appears, it will take some time to load for it's initialization boot so wait 5 or so minutes.
