Make sure you have the most recent Folder for PavLov, that is usually an issue people overlook, There also a built in installer for the Pavlov, just uninstall the old version from Sidequests APP tab, then install and unzip the Pavlov folder and use the "Install batch" in the Pavlov folder, make sure you are using the newest version else some errors such as only one hand at a time, and visual glitching may occur, just use the Install.Bat file while Sidequest is open and your headset is connected, a CMD will run and install it automatically then so wait till it finishes, then close sidequest and open the game in headset under Oculus TV, or unknown sources, if you have issues beyond that click
