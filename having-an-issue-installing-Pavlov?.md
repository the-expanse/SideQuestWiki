Make sure you have the most recent Folder for PavLov, that is usually an issue people overlook, There also a built in installer for the Pavlov, just uninstall the old version from Sidequests APP tab, then install and unzip the Pavlov folder and use the "Install.bat"

it may not have (.bat) at the end but it is still the same thing, also again make sure you are using the newest version else some errors may occur, such as only one hand working at a time and visual glitching , just use the Install.Bat file while Sidequest is open and your headset is connected, a CMD will run and install it automatically then so wait till it finishes, then close sidequest and open the game in headset under Oculus TV, or unknown sources, it will take some time to load for it's initialization boot so wait 5 or so minutes, if you have issues beyond that click [Here](https://discord.gg/wE5ZqBB) to go to the Pavlov Discord, they have a wonderful server that we are sure would be delighted to assist with any issues you may be experiencing, feel free to pop in and ask for help from the pros of Pavlov or voice any concerns about Pavlov to them
